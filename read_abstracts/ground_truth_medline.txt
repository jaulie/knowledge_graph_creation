TI  - Is anorectal endosonography valuable in dyschesia?
PG  - 695-700
AB  - AIMS: Dyschesia can be provoked by inappropriate defecation movements. The aim of 
      this prospective study was to demonstrate dysfunction of the anal sphincter 
      and/or the musculus (m.) puborectalis in patients with dyschesia using anorectal 
      endosonography. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with a medical history of 
      dyschesia and a control group of 20 healthy subjects underwent linear anorectal 
      endosonography (Toshiba models IUV 5060 and PVL-625 RT). In both groups, the 
      dimensions of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis were measured at rest, 
      and during voluntary squeezing and straining. Statistical analysis was performed 
      within and between the two groups. RESULTS: The anal sphincter became 
      paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining (versus the resting state) 
      in 85% of patients but in only 35% of control subjects. Changes in sphincter 
      length were statistically significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in 
      patients compared with control subjects. The m. puborectalis became paradoxically 
      shorter and/or thicker during straining in 80% of patients but in only 30% of 
      controls. Both the changes in length and thickness of the m. puborectalis were 
      significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients versus control 
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Linear anorectal endosonography demonstrated incomplete or 
      even absent relaxation of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis during a 
      defecation movement in the majority of our patients with dyschesia. This study 
      highlights the value of this elegant ultrasonographic technique in the diagnosis 
      of "pelvic floor dyssynergia" or "anismus".

TI  - Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension?
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1186/s12903-015-0054-2 [doi]
LID - 78
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and 
      cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 
      sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension. METHODS: In an 
      observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood 
      pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the 
      tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was 
      measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a 
      noted blood pressure >/= 140 mmHg and/or >/= 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed 
      complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home 
      blood pressure >/= 135 mmHg and/or >/= 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health 
      care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one 
      week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the 
      tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 
      1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, 
      and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a 
      study population of 323 patients. RESULTS: An association between sublingual 
      varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p < 0.002). Mean systolic blood 
      pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual 
      varices, respectively (p < 0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 
      and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively 
      (p < 0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive 
      predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the 
      lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a 
      valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive 
      healthcare.

TI  - Is the affinity column-mediated immunoassay method suitable as an alternative to 
      the microparticle enzyme immunoassay method as a blood tacrolimus assay?
PG  - 3673-8
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.04.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in organ 
      transplantation. Because of its substantial toxic effects, narrow therapeutic 
      index, and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug 
      monitoring of whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations has been recommended. We 
      investigated the comparability of the results of 2 immunoassay systems, affinity 
      column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), 
      comparing differences in the tacrolimus concentrations measured by the 2 methods 
      in relation to the hematologic and biochemical values of hepatic and renal 
      functions. METHODS: A total of 154 samples from kidney or liver transplant 
      recipients were subjected to Dimension RxL HM with a tacrolimus Flex reagent 
      cartilage for the ACMIA method and IMx tacrolimus II for the MEIA method. 
      RESULTS: Tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method (n = 154) closely 
      correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.84). The Bland-Altman 
      plot using concentration differences between the 2 methods and the average of the 
      2 methods showed no specific trends. The tacrolimus levels determined by both the 
      MEIA method and the ACMIA method were not influenced by hematocrit levels, but 
      the difference between the 2 methods (ACMIA - MEIA) tended to be larger in low 
      hematocrit samples (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The ACMIA method used for a tacrolimus 
      assay is precise and has advantages, including the lack of a required 
      pretreatment procedure. Furthermore, it is only slightly influenced by the 
      hematologic or biochemical status of the samples.

TI  - Does a physician's specialty influence the recording of medication history in 
      patients' case notes?
PG  - 308-12
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03202.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To determine the impact of a physician's specialty on the frequency and 
      depth of medication history documented in patient medical records. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional assessment of the frequency and depth of medication history 
      information documented by 123 physicians for 900 randomly selected patients 
      stratified across Cardiology, Chest, Dermatology, Endocrine, Gastroenterology, 
      Haematology, Neurology, Psychiatry and Renal specialties was carried out at a 
      900-bed teaching hospital located in Ibadan, Nigeria. RESULTS: Four hundred and 
      forty-three (49.2%) of the cohort were males and 457 (50.8%) were females; with 
      mean ages 43.2 +/- 18.6 and 43.1 +/- 17.9 years respectively. Physicians' 
      specialties significantly influenced the depth of documentation of the medication 
      history information across the nine specialties (P < 0.0001). Post hoc pair-wise 
      comparisons with Tukey's HSD test showed that the mean scores for adverse drug 
      reactions and adherence to medicines was highest in the Cardiology specialty; 
      while the Chest specialty had the highest mean scores for allergy to drugs, food, 
      chemicals and cigarette smoking. Mean scores for the use of alcohol; illicit 
      drugs; dietary restrictions was highest for Gastroenterology, Psychiatry and 
      Endocrine specialties respectively. Physicians' specialties also significantly 
      influenced the frequency of documentation of the medication history across the 
      nine specialties (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians appear to document more 
      frequently and in greater depth medication history information that may aid the 
      diagnostic tasks in their specific specialty. Researchers and other users of 
      medication history data documented in patients' medical records by physicians may 
      want to take special cognizance of this phenomenon.

TI  - Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using 
      Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy?
PG  - 75-80
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) of rat 
      brains is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes. We 
      address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB 
      could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain 
      tissue to treat malignant glioma. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD Fischer 
      rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was 
      analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused 
      with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to 
      analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples. RESULTS: LITT 
      induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of 
      Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel 
      across the disrupted BBB. CONCLUSIONS: LITT induces a locoregional passage of 
      chemotherapeutic agents into the brain tissue. This is of potential interest for 
      the treatment of brain tumors.

TI  - Spinal subdural hematoma: a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm?
PG  - 408-12; discussion 412
AB  - BACKGROUND: A case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following subarachnoid 
      hemorrhage (SAH) because of a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm is described. 
      Such a case has never been reported. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old woman 
      underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. A computed 
      tomography scan showed that SAH existed predominantly in the posterior fossa and 
      subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium. Intrathecal administration of 
      urokinase, IV administration of fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation via cisternal drainage were performed as 
      prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. On the sixth postoperative day, the 
      patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass 
      effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the 
      sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and 
      had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she 
      was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit. CONCLUSION: Although 
      the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH 
      was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF 
      pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may 
      have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal 
      canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the 
      SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.

TI  - Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women?
PG  - 358-73
LID - 10.1111/jsm.12774 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: For women, the correlation between circulating androgens and sexual 
      desire is inconclusive. Substitution with androgens at physiological levels 
      improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and 
      androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related 
      decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone 
      is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary 
      androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G). AIM: The aim of this study 
      was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and 
      sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than 
      the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into 
      three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at 
      P<0.05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sexual desire was determined as the total score of 
      the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone 
      (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone 
      sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Sexual 
      desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of 
      women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal 
      contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. 
      In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No 
      correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In the 
      present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated 
      with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more 
      strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not 
      superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.

TI  - Is the zeolite hemostatic agent beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial 
      injury?
PG  - 7-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of fatality. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the effect of zeolite mineral (QuikClot - Advanced 
      Clotting Sponge [QC-ACS]) on blood loss and physiological variables in a swine 
      extremity arterial injury model. METHODS: Sixteen swine were used. Oblique groin 
      incision was created and a 5 mm incision was made. The animals were allocated to: 
      control group (n: 6): Pressure dressing was applied with manual pressure over 
      gauze sponge; or QC group (n: 10): QC was directly applied over lacerated femoral 
      artery. Mean arterial pressure, blood loss and physiological parameters were 
      measured during the study period. RESULTS: Application of QC led to a slower drop 
      in blood pressure. The control group had a significantly higher increase in 
      lactate within 60 minutes. The mean prothrombin time in the control group was 
      significantly increased at 60 minutes. The application of QC led to decreased 
      total blood loss. The QC group had significantly higher hematocrit levels. QC 
      application generated a significant heat production. There were mild edematous 
      and vacuolar changes in nerve samples. CONCLUSION: According to the physiological 
      parameters, we observed that zeolite tends to reduce blood loss, however could 
      not stop bleeding completely. We believe that further clinical trials are needed 
      to conclude that zeolite could be used in the routine practice.

TI  - Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade?
PG  - 371-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common primary brain tumors in children and adults are of 
      astrocytic origin. Classic histologic grading schemes for astrocytomas have 
      included evaluating the presence or absence of nuclear abnormalities, mitoses, 
      vascular endothelial proliferation, and tumor necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      evaluated the vascular pattern of 17 astrocytoma surgical specimens (seven from 
      children and 10 from adults), and four normal brains obtained at autopsy, 
      utilizing antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and von Willebrand 
      factor (vWF) utilizing confocal microscopy. A modified WHO classification was 
      used. RESULTS: All tumor cases showed cells positive for GFAP. Control tissues 
      showed a few, widely separated vessels. Pilocytic astrocytomas (four cases) 
      showed lacy clusters of small-to-medium sized vessels, with intact vessel wall 
      integrity. Diffuse, low grade astrocytoma (three cases) showed a staining pattern 
      similar to control tissue; intermediate grade (one case), anaplastic astrocytoma 
      (three cases) and gliobastoma multiforme (six cases) showed an increased vessel 
      density with multiple small vessels (glomeruloid clusters), some with prominent 
      intimal hyperplasia, loss of vessel wall integrity, and with numerous 
      vWF-positive single cells/microvessels within the tumor substance. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Evaluation of astrocytomas utilizing antibody to vWF and confocal microscopy aids 
      in the grading of these neoplasms.

      tomography examination?
PG  - 208-13
LID - 10.1159/000354838 [doi]
AB  - AIM: A clinical study was done to assess the clinical diagnostic accuracy of cone 
      beam computed tomography (CBCT) in detecting proximal cavitated carious lesions 
      in order to determine whether cavitation should be reported when a CBCT 
      examination is available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 79 adjacent proximal surfaces 
      without restorations in permanent teeth were examined. Patients suspected to have 
      carious lesions after a visual clinical and a bitewing examination participated 
      in a CBCT examination (Kodak 9000 3D, 5 x 3.7 cm field of view, voxel size 0.07 
      mm). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained according to the 
      Helsinki Declaration. Radiographic assessment recording lesions with or without 
      cavitation was performed by two observers in bitewings and CBCT sections. 
      Orthodontic separators were placed interdentally between two lesion-suspected 
      surfaces. The separator was removed after 3 days and the surfaces recorded as 
      cavitated (yes/no), i.e. validated clinically. Differences between the two 
      radiographic modalities (sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy) were 
      estimated by analyzing the binary data in a generalized linear model. RESULTS: 
      For both observers, sensitivity was significantly higher for CBCT than for 
      bitewings (average difference 33%, p < 0.001) while specificity was not 
      significantly different between the methods (p = 0.19). The overall accuracy was 
      also significantly higher for CBCT (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: CBCT was more 
      accurate in detecting cavitation in proximal surfaces than bitewing radiographs; 
      therefore a CBCT examination performed for other clinical applications should 
      also be assessed for proximal surface cavities in teeth without restorations, and 
      when detected, this pathology must be part of the dentist's report.

TI  - Ultrasound in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis; a useful addition to clinical 
      staging? A comparison of ultrasound with histopathology.
PG  - 702-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the 
      penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in 
      assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora. METHODS: From 1988 until 
      1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment 
      with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical 
      workup. All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge 
      of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at 
      histopathologic examination. RESULTS: In 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 
      patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were 
      identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the 
      glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue 
      and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into 
      the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate 
      measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen 
      examinations. CONCLUSIONS: While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily 
      done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the 
      glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to 
      physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor 
      to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.

      delivery?
PG  - 2432-4
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2012.700344 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of early sonogram to predict the presentation 
      of twin A at birth. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all 
      twin pregnancies evaluated at our Fetal Evaluation Unit from 2007 to 2009. 
      Sonogram records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at seven 
      gestational age intervals and inpatient medical records were reviewed for the 
      presentation of twin A at delivery. The positive predictive value, sensitivity, 
      and specificity of presentation as determined by ultrasound, at each gestational 
      age interval, for the same presentation at delivery were calculated. RESULTS: Two 
      hundred and thirty-eight twin pregnancies met inclusion criteria. A total of 896 
      ultrasounds were reviewed. The positive predictive value of cephalic presentation 
      of twin A as determined by ultrasound for the persistence of cephalic 
      presentation at delivery reached 95% after 28 weeks gestation. The positive 
      predictive value for noncephalic presentation as established by sonogram for 
      noncephalic at delivery was >90% after 32 weeks gestation. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      presentation of the first twin at delivery can be determined by sonogram by the 
      32nd week of gestation in over 90% of twin pregnancies.

      maxillary alveolar bone was performed by micro-CT. Conventional stereologic-based 
      histomorphometry of 10 bone biopsies was performed by optic microscopy (OM) and 
      low-vacuum surface electronic microscopy (SEM). Percentages of bone between 
      micro-CT and conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry were compared. 
      RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were observed between BV/TV and the 
      percentage of bone (%Bone) analyzed by SEM (r = 0.933, P < 0.001), by toluidine 
      blue staining OM (r = 0.950, P < 0.001) and by dark field OM (r = 0.667, 
      P = 0.05). The high positive correlation coefficient between BV/TV and trabecular 
      thickness illustrates that a value of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone 
      presenting most of their trabecules thicker than 0.2 mm. The high negative 
      correlation between BV/TV and trabecular separation shows that values of BV/TV 
      upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules separated 
      less than 0.3 mm each other. CONCLUSION: BV/TV assessed by micro-CT correlates 
      with the percentage of bone assessed by conventional stereologic-based 
      histomorphometry. Micro-CT is a reliable technique to determine the bone density 
      and the microstructure of the maxillary alveolar bone at the site of dental 
      implant insertion.

      and qualitative study of patient and carer satisfaction.
PG  - 350-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The National Infarct Angioplasty Project assessed the feasibility of 
      establishing a comprehensive primary angioplasty service. We aimed to compare 
      satisfaction at intervention hospitals offering angioplasty-based care and 
      control hospitals offering thrombolysis-based care. DESIGN: Mixed methods, with 
      postal survey of patients and their carers, supported by semi-structured 
      interviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Survey of 682 patients and 486 carers, and 
      interviews with 33 patients and carers, in eight English hospitals. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Primary angioplasty or thrombolysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Responses were received from 595/682 
      patients (87%) and 418/486 carers (86%). Satisfaction with overall care was high 
      at both intervention and control sites (78% vs. 71% patients rated their care as 
      'excellent', P = 0.074). Patient satisfaction was higher at intervention sites 
      for some aspects of care such as speed of treatment (80% vs. 67%'excellent', P = 
      0.001). Convenience of visiting was rated lower at intervention sites by carers 
      (12% vs. 1%'poor', P = 0.001). During interviews, carers reported that they 
      accepted the added inconvenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites in the 
      context of this life-saving treatment. Patient satisfaction with discharge and 
      aftercare was lower in both treatment groups than for other aspects of care. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was 
      acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless 
      of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.

TI  - Is endometrial polyp formation associated with increased expression of vascular 
      endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1?
PG  - 198-203
LID - 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2011.06.036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endometrial polyp is a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, but 
      the etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth 
      factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of 
      endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if 
      endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or 
      TGF-beta1, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related 
      to steroid receptor expression. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective study compared 
      VEGF and TGF-beta1 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue 
      in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for 
      endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The 
      results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and 
      progesterone receptor) expression. RESULTS: The score of VEGF in glandular cells 
      of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent 
      endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase 
      (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was 
      significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative 
      phase (P=0.006). The score of TGF-beta1 in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was 
      significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium in proliferative 
      phase (P=0.02); whereas the score of TGF-beta1 in stromal cells of endometrial 
      polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in 
      the proliferative phase (P=0.006) and the secretory phase (P=0.008). There was a 
      significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors and VEGF and 
      TGF-beta1 (Spearman's correlation P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was increased expression of TGF-beta1 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent 
      normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in 
      endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation 
      between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-beta1 expression.

TI  - Improvements in survival of gynaecological cancer in the Anglia region of 
      England: are these an effect of centralisation of care and use of 
      multidisciplinary management?
PG  - 160-5
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.02961.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our hypothesis is that the adoption of Department of Health (DH) 
      guidance has led to an improvement in outcome in gynaecological cancer survival. 
      SETTING: In 1999 the DH in England introduced the Improving Outcomes in 
      Gynaecological Cancer guidance, advising case management by multidisciplinary 
      teams with surgical concentration in specialist hospitals. This guidance was 
      rapidly adopted in the East of England, with a population of 2.5 million. 
      POPULATION: The population of the Anglia Cancer Network was approximately 2.3 
      million. METHODS: From 1996 to 2003, details of 3406 cases of gynaecological 
      cancer were identified in the Anglia region of England. Survival analysis was 
      performed by Cox proportional hazards regression, relative to cases diagnosed in 
      1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary endpoint was survival. RESULTS: The survival 
      rates for cases diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 were broadly the same across the 
      time period, with a marked improvement taking place in 2000, and continuing to 
      2003 (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79, comparing 2000-03 with 1996-99 diagnoses), for 
      all gynaecological sites combined. Adjustment for treatments or method of case 
      follow-up did not attenuate these improvements. There was a concurrent change 
      towards major surgery being performed in specialist centres from 2000. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of the 1999 guidance on gynaecological cancer, which 
      included multidisciplinary case management and centralisation of surgery, 
      resulted in a marked step-change improvement in survival of gynaecological cancer 
      in an area of eastern England in 2000.

TI  - Estimated fetal weight by ultrasound: a modifiable risk factor for cesarean 
      delivery?

LID - S0002-9378(12)00719-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2012.06.065 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether knowledge of 
      ultrasound-obtained estimated fetal weight (US-EFW) is a risk factor for cesarean 
      delivery (CD). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort from a single center in 
      2009-2010 of singleton, term live births. CD rates were compared for women with 
      and without US-EFW within 1 month of delivery and adjusted for potential 
      confounders. RESULTS: Of the 2329 women in our cohort, 50.2% had US-EFW within 1 
      month of delivery. CD was significantly more common for women with US-EFW (15.7% 
      vs 10.2%; P < .001); after we controlled for confounders, US-EFW remained an 
      independent risk factor for CD (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.1-1.9). The risk increased when US-EFW was >3500 g (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.3-2.7). CONCLUSION: Knowledge of US-EFW, above and beyond 
      the impact of fetal size itself, increases the risk of CD. Acquisition of US-EFW 
      near term appears to be an independent and potentially modifiable risk factor for 
      CD.

TI  - Are financial incentives cost-effective to support smoking cessation during 
      pregnancy?
PG  - 360-70
LID - 10.1111/add.13160 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of up to  pound400 worth of financial 
      incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy as an adjunct to routine health 
      care. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Phase II randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) and a cost-utility analysis using a life-time Markov 
      model. SETTING: The RCT was undertaken in Glasgow, Scotland. The economic 
      analysis was undertaken from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. 
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 612 pregnant women randomized to receive usual cessation 
      support plus or minus financial incentives of up to  pound400 vouchers (US $609), 
      contingent upon smoking cessation. MEASUREMENTS: Comparison of usual support and 
      incentive interventions in terms of cotinine-validated quitters, quality-adjusted 
      life years (QALYs) and direct costs to the NHS. FINDINGS: The incremental cost 
      per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was  pound1127 ($1716).This is similar to the 
      standard look-up value derived from Stapleton & West's published ICER tables, 
       pound1390 per quitter, by looking up the Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial 
      (CIPT) incremental cost ( pound157) and incremental 6-month quit outcome (0.14). The 
      life-time model resulted in an incremental cost of  pound17 [95% confidence interval 
      (CI) = - pound93,  pound107] and a gain of 0.04 QALYs (95% CI = -0.058, 0.145), giving an 
      ICER of  pound482/QALY ($734/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates 
      uncertainty in these results, particularly regarding relapse after birth. The 
      expected value of perfect information was  pound30 million (at a willingness to pay of 
       pound30 000/QALY), so given current uncertainty, additional research is potentially 
      worthwhile. CONCLUSION: Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy 
      are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life 
      years of  pound482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.

TI  - Do adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in 
      postmenopausal women with early breast cancer? Meta-analysis of randomized 
      trials.
PG  - 260-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the advantages from using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared 
      with tamoxifen for early breast cancer, an unexpectedly greater number of grade 3 
      and 4 cardiovascular events (CVAE) (as defined by National Cancer Institute of 
      Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0] was demonstrated. METHODS: Phase 3 
      randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing AI with tamoxifen in early breast 
      cancer were considered eligible for this review. The event-based risk ratios 
      (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived, and a test of 
      heterogeneity was applied. Finally, absolute differences (ADs) in event rates and 
      the number of patients needed to harm 1 patient (NNH) were determined. RESULTS: 
      Seven eligible RCTs (19,818 patients) reported CVAE results. When considering all 
      RCTs, the AD of the primary endpoint (CVAE) between the 2 arms (0.52%), tamoxifen 
      versus AI, was statistically significant (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60; P= .007). 
      This translated into an NNH value of 189 patients; when only third-generation AIs 
      were considered, the difference (0.57%) remained significant (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 
      1.09-1.63; P= .0038). Thromboembolic events were significantly more frequent in 
      the tamoxifen arm, regardless of the strategy adopted (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 
      0.42-0.65; P< .0001), without significant heterogeneity (P= .21). An AD of 1.17% 
      and an NNH value of 85 patients were observed. CONCLUSIONS: According to the 
      results from this meta-analysis, the risk of grade 3 and 4 CVAEs in patients who 
      were receiving AIs was higher compared with the risk in patients who were 
      receiving tamoxifen, and the difference reached statistical significance. 
      However, the AD was relatively low, and from 160 to 180 patients had to be 
      treated to produce 1 event.

TI  - Is fear of anaphylactic shock discouraging surgeons from more widely adopting 
      percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cyst?
PG  - 533-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sources of reports about laparoscopic and percutaneous treatment of 
      liver hydatid cysts are limited to just a few countries. To address the reason 
      behind this, we carried out a survey of 30 surgeons in northern Jordan. METHODS: 
      A questionnaire was distributed to collect data regarding the surgical technique 
      preferred by each surgeon. Further information was collected from those not 
      adopting minimal-access techniques to determine their reasons for not doing so. 
      RESULTS: Only 3 surgeons (10%) considered laparoscopy as the first line of 
      treatment. Of the 27 surgeons who did not consider percutaneous or laparoscopic 
      treatment, fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination was the main reason given by 
      21 surgeons (78%) for not using minimal access techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage 
      surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of 
      hydatid cyst.

TI  - Risk stratification in emergency surgical patients: is the APACHE II score a 
      reliable marker of physiological impairment?
PG  - 55-9
AB  - HYPOTHESES: The APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) 
      score used as an intensive care unit (ICU) admission score in emergency surgical 
      patients is not independent of the effects of treatment and might lead to 
      considerable bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and in the 
      evaluation of treatment policies. Postoperative monitoring with the APACHE II 
      score is clinically irrelevant. DESIGN: Inception cohort study. SETTING: 
      Secondary referral center. PATIENTS: Eighty-five consecutive emergency surgical 
      patients admitted to the surgical ICU in 1999. The APACHE II score was calculated 
      before surgery; after admission to the ICU; and on postoperative days 3, 7, and 
      10. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: APACHE II scores and predicted and observed mortality 
      rates. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD APACHE II score of 24.2 +/- 8.3 at admission to 
      the ICU was approximately 36% greater than the initial APACHE II score of 17.8 
      +/- 7.7, a difference that was highly statistically significant (P<.001). The 
      overall mortality of 32% favorably corresponds with the predicted mortality of 
      34% according to the initial APACHE II score. However, the predicted mortality of 
      50% according to the APACHE II score at admission to the ICU was significantly 
      different from the observed mortality rate (P =.02). In 40 long-term patients 
      (>/=10 days in the ICU), the difference between the APACHE II scores of survivors 
      and patients who died was statistically significant on day 10 (P =.04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is 
      essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal 
      APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving 
      patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.

TI  - Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90 degrees  of Knee 
      Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction?
PG  - 135-40
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to study femoral tunnel lengths drilled with a flexible 
      reamer and the distance to important lateral structures obtained by flexing the 
      knee at various angles and by drilling the guide pins arthroscopically to 
      resemble clinical practice. The purpose of this cadaveric study was twofold: 1. 
      to determine whether femoral tunnel lengths of greater than 20 mm can be created 
      with a flexible reamer system at 90  degrees  of knee flexion and 2. to determine whether 
      the lateral structures of the knee are safe with this technique. METHODS: Ten 
      fresh cadaveric knees were utilized. The intra-osseous length can be measured 
      with a specially de - signed flexible guide pin. Flexible pins were inserted with 
      the knee at 70 degrees , 90 degrees , and 120 degrees  of flexion. The intra-osseous length was measured 
      with the measuring device. Each speci - men was dissected around the lateral 
      aspect of the knee to identify the critical structures, the common peroneal 
      nerve, and the LCL. The distance from the guide pins to the com - mon peroneal 
      nerve and femoral attachment of the LCL were measured with a standard flexible 
      paper ruler to the nearest millimeter. RESULTS: There is a trend for 
      progressively increasing mean intra-osseous length associated with increased 
      flexion of the knee. The mean intra-osseous length for 70 degrees  flexion was 25.2 mm 
      (20 mm to 32 mm), which was statistically significant when compared to mean 
      intra-osseous lengths of 32.1 mm (22 mm to 45 mm) and 38.0 mm (34 mm to 45 mm) in 
      the 90 degrees  and 120 degrees  flexion groups, respectively (p < 0.05). There were no 
      significant differences among the groups with respect to distance to the LCL. 
      There is a trend toward longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with 
      increased flexion. There was a statistically significant dif - ference when 
      comparing 120 degrees  versus 70 degrees  (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study that shows that 
      adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - 
      ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.

TI  - Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed 
      cell death?
PG  - 102
LID - 10.1186/1471-2229-11-102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an 
      organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in 
      its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of 
      longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at 
      the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five 
      cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been 
      recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. 
      RESULTS: The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during 
      developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole 
      within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based 
      on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early 
      stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves 
      were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. 
      Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on 
      characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (DeltaPsim). A 
      TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. 
      Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell 
      imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore 
      (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A 
      (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a 
      significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that 
      displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace 
      plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles 
      during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report 
      of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring 
      structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first 
      time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. 
      Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early 
      role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.

TI  - ["Occult" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute 
      for diagnostic arthroscopy?].
PG  - 433-9
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the actual role of MRI versus arthroscopy in the 
      detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in 
      patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, pain and severe 
      functional impairment. Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee 
      are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; 
      age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, 
      negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients 
      were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 
      0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat 
      suppression. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified three types of occult 
      post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone 
      bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. 
      Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was 
      defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on 
      T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR 
      images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while 
      osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the 
      same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 
      cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury 
      site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated 
      with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 
      90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral 
      compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 
      16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 
      8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial 
      condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent. 
      CONCLUSIONS: After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the 
      available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct 
      visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the 
      subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a 
      very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of 
      occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant 
      correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and 
      between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can 
      help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of 
      post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients usually complain about numbness in the nasal tip after microfat 
      injections. The present study evaluated the severity of the numbness in the nasal 
      tip after the procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To address the research question, 
      a prospective study of young women was designed and performed at the Beijing 
      Anzhen Hospital. Time was the primary predictor variable. The nasal tip 
      sensation, which was evaluated using objective and subjective assessments, was 
      used as the primary outcome variable. The McNemar-Bowker test (time vs nasal tip 
      sensation) was used to detect statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 30 
      young women (age 20.04 +/- 3.63 years) were recruited for the present study. The 
      preoperative mean touch threshold value was 3.60 units. One week after the 
      injection, the women experienced a decrease in the touch threshold value by 2.50 
      units. However, the sensation recovered gradually during the follow-up period 
      (1.51 units at week 2, 2.39 units at week 4, 3.01 units at week 8, and 3.35 units 
      at week 12). Significant differences were detected between multiple different 
      measurement points (P < .05). The percentage of those experiencing paresthesia 
      after the microfat injections also gradually diminished to none. CONCLUSION: 
      Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat 
      injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected 
      to occur over a 3-month period.

TI  - Do some U.S. states have higher/lower injury mortality rates than others?
PG  - 1144-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: This article examines the hypothesis that the six U.S. states with 
      the highest rates of road traffic deaths (group 1 states) also had above-average 
      rates of other forms of injury such as falling, poisoning, drowning, fire, 
      suffocation, homicide, and suicide, and also for the retail trade and 
      construction industries. The converse, second hypothesis, for the six states with 
      the lowest rates of road traffic deaths (group 2 states) is also examined. 
      RESULTS: Data for these 12 states for the period 1983 to 1995 included nine 
      categories of unintentional and four categories of intentional injury. 
      Seventy-four percent of the group 1 states conformed to the first hypothesis, and 
      85% of the group 2 states conformed to the second hypothesis. CONCLUSION: Group 1 
      states are likely to exhibit above-average rates for most other categories of 
      injury death, whereas group 2 states are even more likely to exhibit 
      below-average rates for most other categories of injury death.

TI  - Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors?
PG  - 210-4
LID - 10.1007/s10620-011-1861-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is the functional renal failure associated 
      with advanced cirrhosis and has also been described in fulminant hepatic failure. 
      Without liver transplantation its prognosis is dismal. Our study included 
      patients with type 1 HRS associated with cirrhosis, who were not liver transplant 
      candidates. AIM: To identify variables associated with improved survival. 
      METHODS: Sixty-eight patients fulfilled the revised Ascites Club Criteria for 
      type 1 HRS. None of them was suitable for liver transplantation. All the patients 
      were treated with combinations of: albumin, midodrine and octreotide, pressors, 
      and hemodialysis. RESULTS: Median survival was 13 days for the whole group. 
      Survival varied with the end-stage liver disease (ESLD) etiology: autoimmune, 49 
      days, cardiac cirrhosis, 22 days, idiopathic, 15.5 days, viral, 15 days, 
      hepatitis C and alcohol, 14.5 days, alcohol 8 days, and neoplasia 4 days (p = 
      0.048). Survival of HRS associated with alcoholic liver disease versus other 
      etiologies was not statistically significant (p = 0.1). Increased serum 
      creatinine (p = 0.02) and urinary sodium 6-10 mEq/l (p = 0.027) at the initiation 
      of therapy were prognostic factors for mortality. HRS treatment modalities (p = 
      0.73), use of dialysis (p = 0.56), dialysis modality (p = 0.35), use of 
      vasopressors (p = 0.26), pre-existing renal disease (p = 0.49), gender (p = 
      0.90), and age (p = 0.57) were not associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      report for the first time ESLD etiology as a prognostic factor for survival. The 
      renal function (expressed as serum creatinine) and urinary Na (<5 mEq/l) at the 
      time of diagnosis were found to be associated with survival, suggesting that 
      early treatment might increase survival.

TI  - [The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim "surge" 
      management?].
PG  - 459-65
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent suicide bombings pose the novel problem for Trauma Centers 
      of the massive simultaneous arrival of many gravely wounded patients. METHODS: We 
      report the experience of the French-German Military Trauma Group, a Level 2 
      Trauma Center, in Afghanistan during the wave of suicide bombings in February 
      2007. RESULTS: Fourteen casualties were received. A first triage was carried out 
      by the U S Army Level I group prior to evacuation. A second surgical triage was 
      carried out with systematic ultrasound exam. Four cases (ISS>25) were 
      re-categorized and underwent emergency surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: Suicide 
      bombing in crowded locations near an evacuation hospital may overwhelm the 
      medical resources of the receiving center. It has been referred to as "The Main 
      Gate Syndrome." We introduced the novel concept of a semi-evacuation hospital or 
      receiving center where a second surgical triage was carried out. These 
      exceptional circumstances require open-minded flexibility, a tailored approach, 
      and close cooperation between surgeons and anesthetists to share experience, 
      opinions, and ideas. In the setting of mass casualties, emergency ultrasound exam 
      was shown to be a valuable and effective tool by virtue of its mobility, 
      reproducibility, and immediate results.

LID - 10.5152/akd.2011.037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the construct validity of the Turkish version of the EQ-5D 
      in patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: The study was conducted as a 
      cross-sectional study at the Trakya University Hospital between February and May 
      2008. All patients completed the Turkish version of the EQ-5D and MacNew 
      heart-related quality of life scale. Construct validity of the EQ-5D was assessed 
      according to relationships with MacNew subscales by using Spearman rank 
      correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and 
      twenty-two patients responded to the instruments. Mean age was 62.9+/-9.3 years and 
      male gender (88 or 72.1%) was dominant. Mean score of the EQ-5D index was 
      0.79+/-0.32, while the global score of MacNew was 5.01+/-1.16. The correlation 
      coefficients of the EQ-5D index score with the MacNew subscales ranged from 0.557 
      to 0.721, with EQ-5D VAS score ranging from 0.297 to 0.484 (p<0.001 for all of 
      them). According to the stepwise regression model MacNew global score was found 
      to be significantly effective factor on EQ-5D index score (beta =0.188; 95% CI: 
      0.152-0.224; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility 
      score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies 
      in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

TI  - Is portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement 
      during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments?
PG  - 91-6
LID - ajdm.2013.0115 [pii]
LID - 10.5055/ajdm.2013.0115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of 
      ultrasonography to confirm Schanz pin placement in a cadaveric model, and the 
      interobserver repeatability of the ultrasound methodology. DESIGN: This 
      investigation is a repeated measures cadaveric study with multiple examiners. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Cadaveric preparation and observations were done by an orthopaedic 
      traumatologist and resident, and two general surgery traumatologists. 
      INTERVENTIONS: A total of 16 Schanz pins were equally placed in bilateral femora 
      and tibiae. Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal 
      cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross 
      dissection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length 
      measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection. 
      RESULTS: Schanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography 
      (p < 0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they 
      display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude 
      of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation 
      and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. 
      Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not 
      statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with 
      the ultrasound methodology (p > 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the statistical 
      imparity of pin protrusion measurement via ultrasound compared to that of gross 
      dissection, a consideration of the clinical relevance of ultrasound measurement 
      bias during an austere operating theatre leads to the conclusion that 
      ultrasonography is an adequate methodology for Schanz pin protrusion measurement.

TI  - Is grandmultiparity an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes?
PG  - 277-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes among grandmultiparous women 
      to those of multiparous women 30 years or older. METHODS: A database of the vast 
      majority of maternal and newborn hospital discharge records linked to birth/death 
      certificates was queried to obtain information on all multiparous women with a 
      singleton delivery in the state of California from January 1, 1997 through 
      December 31, 1998. Maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes of grandmultiparous 
      women were compared to multiparous women who were 30 years or older at the time 
      of their last birth. RESULTS: The study population included 25,512 
      grandmultiparous and 265,060 multiparous women 30 years or older as controls. 
      Grandmultiparous women were predominantly Hispanic (56%). After controlling for 
      potential confounding factors, grandmultiparous women were at significantly 
      higher risk for abruptio placentae (odds ratio OR: 1.3; 95% confidence intervals 
      CI: 1.2-1.5), preterm delivery (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), fetal macrosomia (OR: 
      1.5; 95% CI: 1.4-1.6), neonatal death (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.8), postpartum 
      hemorrhage (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.3) and blood transfusion (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 
      1.3-1.8). CONCLUSION: Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal 
      morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, 
      suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during 
      labor and delivery.

TI  - Does depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location? 
      Analysis of ethnic density associations using a large primary-care dataset.
PG  - 1321-9
LID - 10.1017/S0033291715002913 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have linked ethnic differences in depression rates with 
      neighbourhood ethnic density although results have not been conclusive. We looked 
      at this using a novel approach analysing whole population data covering just over 
      one million GP patients in four London boroughs. METHOD: Using a dataset of GP 
      records for all patients registered in Lambeth, Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Newham 
      in 2013 we investigated new diagnoses of depression and antidepressant use for: 
      Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean and black African patients. 
      Neighbourhood effects were assessed independently of GP practice using a 
      cross-classified multilevel model. RESULTS: Black and minority ethnic groups are 
      up to four times less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed 
      antidepressants compared to white British patients. We found an inverse 
      relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis 
      for some groups, where an increase of 10% own-ethnic density was associated with 
      a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduced odds of depression for Pakistani 
      [odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.93], Indian (OR 0.88, 
      CI 0.81-0.95), African (OR 0.88, CI 0.78-0.99) and Bangladeshi (OR 0.94, CI 
      0.90-0.99) patients. Black Caribbean patients, however, showed the opposite 
      effect (OR 1.26, CI 1.09-1.46). The results for antidepressant use were very 
      similar although the corresponding effect for black Caribbeans was no longer 
      statistically significant (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: New depression diagnosis and 
      antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic 
      density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.

TI  - Learning needs of postpartum women: does socioeconomic status matter?
PG  - 86-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about how information needs change over time in the 
      early postpartum period or about how these needs might differ given socioeconomic 
      circumstances. This study's aim was to examine women's concerns at the time of 
      hospital discharge and unmet learning needs as self-identified at 4 weeks after 
      discharge. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a cross-sectional survey of 
      postpartum health outcomes, service use, and costs of care in the first 4 weeks 
      after postpartum hospital discharge. Recruitment of 250 women was conducted from 
      each of 5 hospitals in Ontario, Canada (n = 1,250). Women who had given vaginal 
      birth to a single live infant, and who were being discharged at the same time as 
      their infant, assuming care of their infant, competent to give consent, and able 
      to communicate in one of the study languages were eligible. Participants 
      completed a self-report questionnaire in hospital; 890 (71.2%) took part in a 
      structured telephone interview 4 weeks after hospital discharge. RESULTS: 
      Approximately 17 percent of participants were of low socioeconomic status. 
      Breastfeeding and signs of infant illness were the most frequently identified 
      concerns by women, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Signs of infant 
      illness and infant care/behavior were the main unmet learning needs. Although few 
      differences in identified concerns were evident, women of low socioeconomic 
      status were significantly more likely to report unmet learning needs related to 9 
      of 10 topics compared with women of higher socioeconomic status. For most topics, 
      significantly more women of both groups identified learning needs 4 weeks after 
      discharge compared with the number who identified corresponding concerns while in 
      hospital. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to ensure that new mothers are adequately 
      informed about topics important to them while in hospital. The findings highlight 
      the need for accessible and appropriate community-based information resources for 
      women in the postpartum period, especially for those of low socioeconomic status.

TI  - Is there a differential in the dental health of new recruits to the British Armed 
      Forces? A pilot study.
PG  - E18
LID - 10.1038/sj.bdj.2011.937 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Figures from the British Defence Dental Services reveal that 
      serving personnel in the British Army have a persistently lower level of dental 
      fitness than those in the Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force. No research had been 
      undertaken to ascertain if this reflects the oral health of recruits joining each 
      Service. This study aimed to pilot a process for collecting dental and 
      sociodemographic data from new recruits to each Service and examine the null 
      hypothesis that no differences in dental health existed. METHOD: Diagnostic 
      criteria were developed, a sample size calculated and data collected at the 
      initial training establishments of each Service. RESULTS: Data for 432 
      participants were entered into the analysis. Recruits in the Army sample had a 
      significantly greater prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource 
      need than either of the other two Services. Army recruits had a mean number of 
      2.59 (2.08, 3.09) decayed teeth per recruit, compared to 1.93 (1.49, 2.39 p 
      <0.01) in Royal Navy recruits and 1.26 (0.98, 1.53 p <0.001) in Royal Air Force 
      recruits. Among Army recruits 62.7% were from the two most deprived quintiles of 
      the Index of Multiple Deprivation compared to 42.5% of Royal Naval recruits and 
      36.6% of Royal Air Force recruits. CONCLUSION: A significant difference in dental 
      health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a 
      reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.

TI  - Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 
      5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term?
PG  - 1102-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be 
      related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an 
      adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it 
      decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it 
      may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. OBJECTIVES: To look at the effect of 
      stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established 
      on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity 
      (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to 
      report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate. METHODS: In a prospective, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were 
      established on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop 
      their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. 
      Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then 
      at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr. RESULTS: Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded 
      the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the 
      placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because 
      of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the 
      placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower 
      disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not 
      of clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to continue FA 
      supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to 
      prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and 
      vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing 
      neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.

TI  - Can teaching medical students to investigate medication errors change their 
      attitudes towards patient safety?
PG  - 319-25
LID - 10.1136/bmjqs.2010.041376 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a 
      patient-safety curriculum administered during a paediatric clerkship on medical 
      students' attitudes towards patient safety. METHODS: Medical students viewed an 
      online video introducing them to systems-based analyses of medical errors. 
      Faculty presented an example of a medication administration error and 
      demonstrated use of the Learning From Defects tool to investigate the defect. 
      Student groups identified and then analysed medication errors during their 
      clinical rotation using the Learning From Defects framework to organise and 
      present their findings. Outcomes included patient safety attitudinal changes, as 
      measured by questions derived from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. RESULTS: 
      108 students completed the curriculum between July 2008 and July 2009. All 
      student groups (25 total) identified, analysed and presented patient safety 
      concerns. Curriculum effectiveness was demonstrated by significant changes on 
      questionnaire items related to patient safety attitudes. The majority of students 
      felt that the curriculum was relevant to their clinical rotation and should 
      remain part of the clerkship. CONCLUSIONS: An active learning curriculum 
      integrated into a clinical clerkship can change learners' attitudes towards 
      patient safety. Students found the curriculum relevant and recommended its 
      continuation.

TI  - Does a delay in transfer to a rehabilitation unit for older people affect outcome 
      after fracture of the proximal femur?
PG  - 547-9
AB  - AIMS: To detemine the relationship between delay in transfer to rehabilitation 
      wards and outcome for patients aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal 
      femur. METHODS: An observational study in a district general hospital of all 
      patients admitted to hospital aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal 
      femur over 3 1/2 years. Outcome data collected included the number of patients 
      discharged back to their usual residence and total hospital length of stay 
      related to age, gender, usual residence and delay in transfer to a rehabilitation 
      ward. RESULTS: 58% of 455 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation ward. For 
      those patients who were transferred to a rehabilitation ward only age predicted 
      discharge to a more dependent residence. The relative risk for discharge to a 
      more dependent residence for people aged over 85 years compared to younger people 
      was 1.47 (95% CI 1.15-1.88). Delay in transfer to rehabilitation was associated 
      with a longer total hospital length of stay of 0.64 (95% CI 0.23-1.05) days per 
      day of delay in transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward 
      was associated with a disproportionate increase in total hospital length of stay 
      for patients aged over 75 with fracture of the proximal femur.

TI  - Are there gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in 
      seeking medical help for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction?
PG  - 221-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify gender differences in delay time and the reasons why 
      African Americans delay in seeking medical care for symptoms of acute myocardial 
      infarction (AMI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Five hospitals in the San 
      Francisco and East Bay areas. PATIENTS: Sixty-one African American men and women 
      diagnosed with an AMI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prehospital delay time. RESULTS: 
      Median delay time was longer for women compared to men (4.4 hours vs 3.5 hours), 
      although the difference was not significant. Single women delayed longer than 
      single men (P = .03), and women who were alone when symptoms began delayed longer 
      than women with someone (P = .03). Women who received advice to seek help or call 
      911 upon symptom onset had shorter delays compared to women who were not advised 
      to call 911 (P = .01). Men at home delayed longer than men who experienced their 
      symptoms outside the home (P = .01). Men with emergency room insurance delayed 
      longer than men without emergency room insurance (P = .03), and men who took an 
      ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times than men who took other means 
      of transportation (P = .04). CONCLUSION: Women compared to men often delay 
      seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings 
      suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African 
      Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.

TI  - Does ambulatory process of care predict health-related quality of life outcomes 
      for patients with chronic disease?
PG  - 63-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The validity of quality of care measurement has important implications 
      for practicing clinicians, their patients, and all involved with health care 
      delivery. We used empirical data from managed care patients enrolled in west 
      coast physician organizations to test the hypothesis that observed changes in 
      health-related quality of life across a 2.5-year window reflecting process of 
      care. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Patient self-report data as well as clinically 
      detailed medical record review regarding 963 patients with chronic disease 
      associated with managed care from three west coast states. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Prospective cohort study of change in health-related quality of life scores 
      across 30 months as measured by change in SF-12 physical component scores. DATA 
      COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Patient self-report and medical record 
      abstraction. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a positive relationship between better 
      process scores and higher burden of illness (p<.05). After adjustment for burden 
      of illness, using an instrumental variables approach revealed better process is 
      associated with smaller declines in SF-12 scores across a 30-month observation 
      window (p=.014). The application of the best quartile of process of care to 
      patients currently receiving poor process is associated with a 4.24 increment in 
      delta SF-12-physical component summary scores. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 
      instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship 
      between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of 
      life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process 
      of care.

TI  - Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of 
      chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer? Preliminary in vitro 
      investigations.
PG  - 699-701
AB  - PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The endogenous estradiol metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol 
      (2ME), has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cell growth and a strong 
      anti-angiogenic substance. We investigated for the first time whether in vitro 
      combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an 
      additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. 
      METHOD: As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All 
      cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) 
      and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, 
      carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was 
      measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. RESULTS: For both 
      ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and 
      carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these 
      chemotherapeutic substances. CONCLUSION: 2ME is able to enhance the 
      antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological 
      relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II 
      trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability 
      has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may 
      therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent 
      cancer.

TI  - Does a dedicated discharge coordinator improve the quality of hospital discharge?
PG  - 89-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the role of a discharge coordinator 
      whose sole responsibility was to plan and coordinate the discharge of patients 
      from medical wards. DESIGN: An intervention study in which the quality of 
      discharge planning was assessed before and after the introduction of a discharge 
      coordinator. Patients were interviewed on the ward before discharge and seven to 
      10 days after being discharged home. SETTING: The three medical wards at the 
      Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London. PATIENTS: 600 randomly sampled adult 
      patients admitted to the medical wards of the study hospital, who were resident 
      in the district (but not in institutions), were under the care of physicians 
      (excluding psychiatry), and were discharged home from one of the medical wards. 
      The sampling was conducted in three study phases, over 18 months. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Phase I comprised base line data collection; in phase II data were collected 
      after the introduction of the district discharge planning policy and a discharge 
      form (checklist) for all patients; in phase III data were collected after the 
      introduction of the discharge coordinator. MAIN MEASURES: The quality and out 
      come of discharge planning. Readmission rates, duration of stay, appropriateness 
      of days of care, patients' health and satisfaction, problems after discharge, and 
      receipt of services. RESULTS: The discharge coordinator resulted in an improved 
      discharge planning process, and there was a reduction in problems experienced by 
      patients after discharge, and in perceived need for medical and healthcare 
      services. There was no evidence that the discharge coordinator resulted in a more 
      timely or effective provision of community services after discharge, or that the 
      appropriateness or efficiency of bed use was improved. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge 
      planning, but at additional cost.

TI  - Impact of MPH programs: contributing to health system strengthening in low- and 
      middle-income countries?
PG  - 52
LID - 10.1186/s12960-016-0150-7 [doi]
LID - 52
AB  - BACKGROUND: The "health workforce" crisis has led to an increased interest in 
      health professional education, including MPH programs. Recently, it was 
      questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health 
      prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and 
      middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously 
      difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of 
      MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as "impact on workplace" and 
      "impact on society," which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted 
      and to what effect within the context of the graduates' workplaces, as well as on 
      societal health. METHODS: This is part of a larger six-country mixed method 
      study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English 
      language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the 
      other a residential program in the Netherlands. Both offer MPH training to 
      students from a diversity of countries. In-depth interviews were conducted with 
      10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, 
      their peers, and their supervisors. RESULTS: Impact on the workplace was reported 
      as considerable by graduates and peers as well as supervisors and included 
      changes in management and leadership: promotion to a leadership position as well 
      as expanded or revitalized management roles were reported by many participants. 
      The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, 
      and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in 
      the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting 
      up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and 
      training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' 
      influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral 
      approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, 
      policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and 
      context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates 
      were able to have effect. Self-selection of graduates and their role in selecting 
      peers and supervisors may have resulted in some bias, some graduates could not be 
      traced, and social acceptability bias may have influenced findings. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was considerable impact at many levels; graduates were perceived to be able 
      to contribute significantly to their workplaces and often had influence at the 
      national level. Much of the impact described was in line with public health 
      educational aims. The qualitative method study revealed more in-depth 
      understanding of graduates' impact as well as their career pathways.

TI  - Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities: Are they detected by rapid 
      prescreening?
PG  - 739-44
LID - 10.1002/cncy.21601 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid prescreening (RPS) is one of the quality assurance (QA) methods 
      used in gynecologic cytology. The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but 
      mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far 
      specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell 
      abnormalities. METHODS: A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS 
      during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as "review for abnormality" (R) 
      if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of 
      undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be 
      present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then 
      underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given 
      a cytologic interpretation. RESULTS: The final cytologic interpretation was a 
      glandular cell abnormality (>/=AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) 
      were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had 
      histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial 
      lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on 
      RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and 
      represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on 
      histologic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities 
      are often flagged as abnormal by RPS, and this results in a sensitivity of 36.4% 
      (at the AGC threshold). Most importantly, some cases of AGC are detected on Pap 
      smears by RPS only, and this demonstrates that RPS is a valuable QA method.

TI  - Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating 
      unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?
PG  - 159-76
LID - 10.3233/RNN-140448 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or 
      absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally 
      conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), 
      respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of 
      possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. 
      The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of 
      a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the 
      presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even 
      when no conscious behavior can be observed. METHODS: We enrolled 25 severe DOC 
      patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy 
      individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation 
      evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective 
      connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components 
      were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. 
      RESULT: a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all 
      HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. 
      CONCLUSION: a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers 
      in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a 
      motor-output failure.

TI  - Is etoricoxib effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after primary 
      total hip arthroplasty?
PG  - 583-7
LID - 10.1007/s00264-013-1781-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Heterotopic ossification is a common complication after total hip 
      arthroplasty. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to prevent 
      heterotopic ossifications effectively, however gastrointestinal complaints are 
      reported frequently. In this study, we investigated whether etoricoxib, a 
      selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor that produces fewer 
      gastrointestinal side effects, is an effective alternative for the prevention of 
      heterotopic ossification. METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of oral 
      etoricoxib 90 mg for seven days in a prospective two-stage study design for 
      phase-2 clinical trials in a small sample of patients (n = 42). A cemented 
      primary total hip arthroplasty was implanted for osteoarthritis. Six months after 
      surgery, heterotopic ossification was determined on anteroposterior pelvic 
      radiographs using the Brooker classification. RESULTS: No heterotopic 
      ossification was found in 62 % of the patients that took etoricoxib; 31 % of the 
      patients had Brooker grade 1 and 7 % Brooker grade 2 ossification. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Etoricoxib seems effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after total hip 
      arthroplasty. This finding further supports the use of COX-2 inhibitors for the 
      prevention of heterotopic ossification following total hip arthroplasty.

LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2015.10.092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Longitudinally following patients requires a full-time employee 
      (FTE)-dependent data inflow infrastructure. There are efforts to capture 
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by the use of non-FTE-dependent methodologies. 
      In this study, we set out to assess the reliability of PRO data captured via 
      FTE-dependent compared with non-FTE-dependent methodologies. METHODS: A total of 
      119 adult patients (65 men) who underwent 1-and 2-level lumbar fusions at Duke 
      University Medical Center were enrolled in this prospective study. Enrollment 
      criteria included available demographic, clinical, and PRO data. All patients 
      completed 2 sets of questionnaires--the first a phone interviews and the second a 
      self-survey. There was at least a 2-week period between the phone interviews and 
      self-survey. Questionnaires included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the 
      visual analog scale for back pain (VAS-BP), and the visual analog scale for leg 
      pain (VAS-LP). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the 
      reliability of baseline PRO data captured. RESULTS: A total of 39.49% of patients 
      were smokers, 21.00% had diabetes, and 11.76% had coronary artery disease; 26.89% 
      reported history of anxiety disorder, and 28.57% reported history of depression. 
      A total of 97.47% of patients had a high-school diploma or General Education 
      Development, and 49.57% attained a 4-year college degree or postgraduate degree. 
      We observed a high correlation between baseline PRO data captured between 
      FTE-dependent versus non-FTE dependent methodologies (ODI: r = -0.89, VAS-BP: r = 
      0.74, VAS-LP: r = 0.70). There was no difference in PROs of baseline pain and 
      functional disability between FTE-dependent and non-FTE-dependent methodologies: 
      baseline ODI (FTE-dependent: 47.73 +/- 16.77 [mean +/- SD] vs. non-FTE-dependent: 
      45.81 +/- 12.11, P = 0.39), VAS-LP (FTE-dependent: 6.13 +/- 2.78 vs. 
      non-FTE-dependent: 6.46 +/- 2.79, P = 0.36) and VAS-BP (FTE-dependent: 6.33 +/- 2.90 
      vs. non-FTE-dependent: 6.53 +/- 2.48, P = 0.57). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests 
      that there is great reliability between PRO data captured between FTE-dependent 
      and non-FTE-dependent methodologies.

TI  - Can emergency physicians accurately and reliably assess acute vertigo in the 
      emergency department?
PG  - 126-31
LID - 10.1111/1742-6723.12372 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate a clinical diagnostic tool, used by emergency physicians 
      (EPs), to diagnose the central cause of patients presenting with vertigo, and to 
      determine interrater reliability of this tool. METHODS: A convenience sample of 
      adult patients presenting to a single academic ED with isolated vertigo (i.e. 
      vertigo without other neurological deficits) was prospectively evaluated with 
      STANDING (SponTAneousNystagmus, Direction, head Impulse test, standiNG) by five 
      trained EPs. The first step focused on the presence of spontaneous nystagmus, the 
      second on the direction of nystagmus, the third on head impulse test and the 
      fourth on gait. The local standard practice, senior audiologist evaluation 
      corroborated by neuroimaging when deemed appropriate, was considered the 
      reference standard. Sensitivity and specificity of STANDING were calculated. On 
      the first 30 patients, inter-observer agreement among EPs was also assessed. 
      RESULTS: Five EPs with limited experience in nystagmus assessment volunteered to 
      participate in the present study enrolling 98 patients. Their average evaluation 
      time was 9.9 +/- 2.8 min (range 6-17). Central acute vertigo was suspected in 16 
      (16.3%) patients. There were 13 true positives, three false positives, 81 true 
      negatives and one false negative, with a high sensitivity (92.9%, 95% CI 70-100%) 
      and specificity (96.4%, 95% CI 93-38%) for central acute vertigo according to 
      senior audiologist evaluation. The Cohen's kappas of the first, second, third and 
      fourth steps of the STANDING were 0.86, 0.93, 0.73 and 0.78, respectively. The 
      whole test showed a good inter-observer agreement (k = 0.76, 95% CI 0.45-1). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the hands of EPs, STANDING showed a good inter-observer agreement 
      and accuracy validated against the local standard of care.

TI  - Proof of concept study: does fenofibrate have a role in sleep apnoea syndrome?
PG  - 1185-92
LID - 10.1185/03007991003693581 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of fenofibrate on sleep apnoea indices. 
      METHODS: Proof-of-concept study comprising a placebo run-in period (1 week, 5 
      weeks if fibrate washout was required) and a 4-week randomized, double-blind 
      treatment period. Thirty-four subjects (mean age 55 years, body mass index 34 
      kg/m 2 , fasting triglycerides 3.5 mmol/L) with diagnosed sleep apnoea syndrome 
      not treated with continuous positive airways pressure were enrolled and 
      randomized to once daily treatment with fenofibrate (145 mg NanoCrystal(R) 
      tablet) or placebo. Overnight polysomnography, computerized attention/vigilance 
      tests and blood sampling for measurement of lipids, insulin, fasting plasma 
      glucose and fibrinogen were performed at the end of each study period. CLINICAL 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00816829. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: As this was an 
      exploratory study, a range of sleep variables were evaluated. The 
      apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and percentage of time spent with arterial oxygen 
      saturation (SpO(2)) <90% were relevant as they have been evaluated in other 
      clinical trials. Other variables included total apnoeas, hypopnoeas and oxygen 
      desaturations, and non-cortical micro-awakenings related to respiratory events 
      per hour. RESULTS: Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced the percentage of 
      time with SpO(2) <90% (from 9.0% to 3.5% vs. 10.0% to 11.5% with placebo, p = 
      0.007), although there was no significant change in the AHI (reduction vs. 
      control 14% (95%CI -47 to 40%, p = 0.533). Treatment reduced obstructive apnoeas 
      (by 44%, from 18.5 at baseline to 15.0 at end of treatment vs. 29.0 to 30.5 on 
      placebo, p = 0.048), and non-cortical micro-awakenings per hour (from 23.5 to 
      18.0 vs. 24.0 to 25.0 with placebo, p = 0.004). Other sleep variables were not 
      significantly influenced by fenofibrate. KEY LIMITATIONS: Exploratory study in 
      patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea, limited treatment duration; 
      concomitant hypnotic treatment (35%); lack of correction for multiplicity of 
      testing. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent direction of change in sleep indices in this 
      proof-of-concept study may support further investigation of fenofibrate in 
      moderate to severe sleep apnoea syndrome.

TI  - Does implant coating with antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduce bacterial 
      colonization and biofilm formation in vitro?
PG  - 3311-23
LID - 10.1007/s11999-014-3558-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implant-related infections represent one of the most severe 
      complications in orthopaedics. A fast-resorbable, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel 
      may reduce or prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation of implanted 
      biomaterials. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Is a fast-resorbable hydrogel 
      able to deliver antibacterial compounds in vitro? (2) Can a hydrogel (alone or 
      antibacterial-loaded) coating on implants reduce bacterial colonization? And (3) 
      is intraoperative coating feasible and resistant to press-fit implant insertion? 
      METHODS: We tested the ability of Disposable Antibacterial Coating (DAC) hydrogel 
      (Novagenit Srl, Mezzolombardo, Italy) to deliver antibacterial agents using 
      spectrophotometry and a microbiologic assay. Antibacterial and antibiofilm 
      activity were determined by broth microdilution and a crystal violet assay, 
      respectively. Coating resistance to press-fit insertion was tested in rabbit 
      tibias and human femurs. RESULTS: Complete release of all tested antibacterial 
      compounds was observed in less than 96 hours. Bactericidal and antibiofilm effect 
      of DAC hydrogel in combination with various antibacterials was shown in vitro. 
      Approximately 80% of the hydrogel coating was retrieved on the implant after 
      press-fit insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded 
      hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: A fast-resorbable, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel coating may help 
      prevent implant-related infections in orthopaedics. However, further validation 
      in animal models and properly controlled human studies is required.

TI  - Does bone anchor fixation improve the outcome of percutaneous bladder neck 
      suspension in female stress urinary incontinence?
PG  - 192-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of a new modification of percutaneous needle 
      suspension, using a bone anchor system for fixing the suture at the public bone, 
      and to compare the results with those published previously. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      From March 1996, 37 patients with stress urinary incontinence (> 2 years) were 
      treated using a bone anchor system. On each side the suture was attached to the 
      pubocervical fascia and the vaginal wall via a broad 'Z'-stitch. A urodynamic 
      investigation performed preoperatively in all patients confirmed stress 
      incontinence and excluded detrusor instability. The outcome was assessed by 
      either by a clinical follow-up investigation or using a standardized 
      questionnaire, over a mean follow-up of 11 months (range 6-18). RESULTS: In the 
      37 patients, the procedure was successful in 25 (68%), with 16 (43%) of the 
      patients completely dry and nine (24%) significantly improved. Removal of the 
      bone anchor and suture was necessary in two patients, because of unilateral 
      bacterial infection in one and a bilateral soft tissue granuloma in the other. 
      One bone anchor became dislocated in a third patient. In two cases where the 
      treatment failed, new detrusor instability was documented urodynamically. Minor 
      complications were prolonged wound pain in 10 (26%) and transient urinary 
      retention or residual urine in 12 patients (32%). CONCLUSION: The poor success 
      rate in the study corresponds with the long-term results of conventional or 
      modified needle suspension procedures and does not reinforce the optimistic 
      results of bone anchoring published recently. Because of the poorer long-term 
      results from percutaneous needle suspension than from other techniques of open 
      retropubic bladder neck suspension, it remains questionable whether percutaneous 
      needle suspension should be considered a first-line procedure for the treatment 
      of female stress urinary incontinence.

TI  - Is leptin involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity? Potential 
      clinical implications.
PG  - 1944-50
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32833c21af [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hyperleptinemia and oxidative stress play a major role in the 
      development of cardiovascular diseases in obesity. This study aimed to 
      investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and 
      phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, 
      and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients. 
      METHODS: The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals 
      (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic 
      cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid 
      intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we 
      performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 
      murine macrophages. RESULTS: Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels 
      were enhanced (P < 0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase 
      activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association 
      remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P < 0.05) in 
      obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated 
      positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro 
      studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the 
      leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide 
      suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein 
      kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation 
      promoted macrophage proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that 
      phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity is increased in obesity and is related to 
      preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition. We also suggest that 
      hyperleptinemia may contribute to phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in 
      obesity.

PG  - 525-32
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.03.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate longitudinal 
      predictors of fear of recurrence in survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) using 
      Leventhal's Common Sense Model (CSM) as a framework. The research questions were 
      as follows: (a) to what extent do HNC patients report fear of cancer recurrence? 
      (b) To what extent are fears of recurrence manifestations of illness-related 
      anxiety? (c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, 
      disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic 
      factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence? 
      METHODS: A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 
      newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed 
      measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and 
      depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of 
      recurrence only). RESULTS: A third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported 
      relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar 
      levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related 
      to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and 
      educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors. Path 
      analyses demonstrated that fears of cancer recurrence after treatment were 
      directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism. CONCLUSION: Although 
      components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping 
      strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be 
      the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear 
      reported prior to treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Specific markers for differentiation of nonalcoholic (NASH) from 
      alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) are lacking. We investigated the role of routine 
      laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. METHODS: Liver biopsies 
      performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with 
      steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The 
      diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis 
      of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (< 140 g/week). Logistic 
      regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS: NASH was diagnosed in 58 
      patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, 
      P < 0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio > 1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more 
      common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH 
      patients (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the 
      AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 
      0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent 
      predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in 
      high-grade fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect 
      the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. 
      Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for 
      liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.

TI  - Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic 
      trauma severity?
PG  - 328-334
LID - 10.1007/s00595-016-1443-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a rare but life-threatening type of 
      injury. We investigate whether the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the 
      severity of aortic injury. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of twenty-two 
      cases treated with TEVAR for TAI in our department from 2009 to 2014. Aortic 
      injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of 
      Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, 
      based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. RESULTS: The 
      mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8 cm and 58.3 degrees , 
      respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4 cm and 45.9 degrees  in the type III group; 
      3.3 cm and 37 degrees  in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both 
      the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A 
      multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly 
      associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic 
      arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and 
      the aortic arch index.

TI  - The Prevalence of Incidentally Detected Idiopathic Misty Mesentery 
      on Multidetector Computed Tomography: Can Obesity Be the Triggering Cause?
PG  - 212-7
LID - S0846-5371(15)00087-X [pii]

AB  - PURPOSE: Misty mesentery appearance is commonly reported in daily practice, 
      usually as a secondary finding of various pathological entities, but sometimes it 
      is encountered as an isolated finding that cannot be attributed to any other 
      disease entity. We aimed to assess the prevalence of cases with incidentally 
      detected idiopathic misty mesentery on computed tomography (CT) and to summarize 
      the pathologies leading to this appearance. METHODS: Medical records and initial 
      and follow-up CT features of patients with misty mesentery appearance between 
      January 2011 and January 2013 were analysed. The study included cases with no 
      known cause of misty mesentery according to associated CT findings, clinical 
      history, or biochemical manifestations, and excluded patients with diseases known 
      to cause misty mesentery, lymph nodes greater than a short-axis diameter of 5 mm, 
      discrete mesenteric masses, or bowel wall thickening. RESULTS: There were a total 
      of 561 patients in whom misty mesentery appearance was depicted on abdominopelvic 
      CT scans. A total of 80 cases were found to have isolated incidental idiopathic 
      misty mesentery, giving a prevalence of 7%. The common indication for CT 
      examination was abdominal pain. There was a slight female predominance (51.3%). 
      67.5% of all patients were classified as obese and 17.5% as overweight. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental 
      misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass 
      index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory 
      changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and 
      misty mesentery appearance on CT.

TI  - Fast foods - are they a risk factor for asthma?
PG  - 1537-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle changes over the last 30 years are the most likely 
      explanation for the increase in allergic disease over this period. AIM: This 
      study tests the hypothesis that the consumption of fast food is related to the 
      prevalence of asthma and allergy. METHODS: As part of the International Study of 
      Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) a cross-sectional prevalence study of 
      1321 children (mean age = 11.4 years, range: 10.1-12.5) was conducted in 
      Hastings, New Zealand. Using standard questions we collected data on the 
      prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms, as well as food frequency data. Skin 
      prick tests were performed to common environmental allergens and exercise-induced 
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was assessed according to a standard 
      protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2) and 
      classified into overweight and obese according to a standard international 
      definition. RESULTS: After adjusting for lifestyle factors, including other diet 
      and BMI variables, compared with children who never ate hamburgers, we found an 
      independent risk of hamburger consumption on having a history of wheeze 
      [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06-1.96) and 1+ times a 
      week (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07-2.52)] and on current wheeze [consumption less than 
      once a week (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.80-1.70) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.81, 95% 
      CI: 1.10-2.98)]. Takeaway consumption 1+ times a week was marginally 
      significantly related to BHR (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 0.99-5.91). There was no effect 
      on atopy. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent 
      association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a 
      similar association with BHR.

TI  - Assessment of appropriate antimicrobial prescribing: do experts agree?
PG  - 2980-7
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkw207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the validity and reliability of expert 
      assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance 
      in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' 
      assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with 
      the assessments of their colleagues. METHODS: Twenty-four doctors specialized in 
      infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) 
      from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial 
      agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They 
      were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created 
      a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment 
      of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater 
      overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease 
      physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. 
      RESULTS: Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 
      75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively. This 
      did not differ by clinical specialty, hospital or years of experience, and 
      residents had similar results. Specialists agreed with the index expert in 76% of 
      cases and the index expert agreed with his previous assessments in 71% of cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology 
      assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of 
      indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their 
      experience or hospital of employment. However, there is room for improvement, 
      which merits attention in multidisciplinary discussions and education.

TI  - Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: 
      are we operating too late?
PG  - 1670-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate right ventricular (RV) 
      volume and function after pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) and to address the 
      issue of optimal surgical timing in these patients. BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary 
      regurgitation (PR) following repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) leads to RV 
      dilation and an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death in adult patients. 
      METHODS: We studied 25 consecutive adult patients who underwent PVR for 
      significant PR late after repair of TOF. Radionuclide angiography was performed 
      in all at a mean of 8.2 months (+/- 8 months) before PVR and repeated at a mean 
      of 28.0 months (+/- 22.8 months) after the operation. Right ventricular (RV) 
      end-systolic volume (RVESV), RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and RV ejection 
      fraction (RVEF) were measured. RESULTS: Mean RVEDV, RVESV and RVEF remained 
      unchanged after PVR (227.1 ml versus 214.9 ml, p = 0.74; 157.4 ml versus 155.4 
      ml, p = 0.94; 35.6% versus 34.7%, p = 0.78, respectively). Of the 10 patients 
      with RVEF > or = 0.40 before PVR, 5 patients (50%) maintained a RVEF > or = 0.40 
      following PVR, whereas only 2 out of 15 patients (13%) with pre-operative values 
      <0.40 reached an RVEF > or = 0.40 postoperatively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Right 
      ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary 
      regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In 
      order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these 
      patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.

TI  - Is amoxapine an atypical antipsychotic? Positron-emission tomography 
      investigation of its dopamine2 and serotonin2 occupancy.
PG  - 1217-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: All currently available atypical antipsychotics have, at clinically 
      relevant doses: i) high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy; ii) greater 5-HT2 than 
      dopamine (D)2 occupancy; and iii) a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side 
      effects when their D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. A review of pharmacologic and 
      behavioral data suggested that amoxapine should also conform to this profile; 
      therefore, we undertook a positron-emission tomography (PET) study of its 5-HT2 
      and D2 occupancy. METHODS: Seven healthy volunteers received 50-250 mg/day of 
      amoxapine for 5 days and then had [11C]-raclopride and [18F]-setoperone PET 
      scans. RESULTS: 5-HT2 receptors showed near saturation at doses of 100 mg/day and 
      above. The D2 receptor occupancies showed a dose-dependent increase, never 
      exceeding 80%; at all doses 5-HT2 occupancy exceeded D2 occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established 
      atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro 
      pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic 
      depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an "atypical" antipsychotic 
      agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.

TI  - Do older patients who refuse to participate in a self-management intervention in 
      the Netherlands differ from older patients who agree to participate?
PG  - 266-71
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Refusal of patients to participate in intervention programs 
      is an important problem in clinical trials but, in general, researchers devote 
      relatively little attention to it. In this article, a comparison is made between 
      patients who, after having been invited, agreed to participate in a 
      self-management intervention (participants) and those who refused (refusers). 
      Compared with other studies of refusers, relatively more information could be 
      gathered with regard to both their characteristics and reasons for refusing, 
      because all potential participants were invited personally. METHODS: Older 
      patients from a Dutch outpatient clinic were invited to participate in a 
      self-management intervention, and their characteristics were assessed. 
      Demographic data were collected, as well as data on physical functioning and lack 
      of emotional support. People who refused to participate were asked to give their 
      reasons for refusing. RESULTS: Of the 361 patients invited, 267 (74%) refused 
      participation. These refusers were more restricted in their mobility, lived 
      further away from the location of the intervention, and had a partner more often 
      than did the participants. No differences were found in level of education, age 
      or gender. The main reasons given by respondents for refusing to participate were 
      lack of time, travel distance, and transport problems. CONCLUSIONS: As in many 
      studies, the refusal rate in this study is high, and seems to be related to 
      physical mobility restrictions, travel distance and, partly, to availability of 
      emotional support. These findings may be used to make the recruitment process 
      more effective - for example, by offering transport to the location of the 
      intervention.

TI  - Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs 
      input?
PG  - 715-9
LID - 10.3109/00016489.2012.656286 [doi]
AB  - CONCLUSION: Otolith organs input influences the axis of horizontal semicircular 
      canal ocular reflex; therefore, the plane of compensatory eye movements induced 
      by the horizontal canal stimulation is not always parallel to the canal. 
      OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by 
      otolith organs input. METHODS: The subjects were seven healthy humans. The right 
      ear was stimulated using ice-water. Each subject was kept in a left-ear-down 
      position for 20 s and then repositioned to a prone position, a right-ear-down 
      position and a supine position with 20 s intervals. Nystagmus was analysed using 
      three-dimensional video-oculography. RESULTS: Eye movements in the supine 
      position and the prone position were not in a symmetric fashion. Nystagmus in the 
      left-ear-down position and the right-ear-down position were not symmetric either. 
      These phenomena indicate that the axis of the eyeball rotation was affected by 
      the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head.

TI  - Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia: does it 
      matter?
PG  - 1054-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite surgical refinements, perioperative use of 
      tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) as part of surgical approach to esophageal atresia (EA) 
      is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence 
      of preoperative TBS in newborns with EA in preventing complications and improving 
      diagnosis and surgical treatment. METHODS: In the period ranging from 1997 to 
      2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried 
      out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide 
      carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and 
      cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy. Type of EA, surgical procedure variations 
      caused by TBS, and associated anomalies not easily detectable were recorded. 
      RESULTS: Before TBS, the Gross classification of the 62 patients was as follows: 
      type A, 9 patients; type B, none; type C, 51 patients. At TBS, however, 3 of 9 
      type A patients had an unsuspected proximal fistula (type B). These 3 patients, 
      plus the 2 with H-type fistula, were repaired through a cervical approach. In 4 
      patients, previously undetected malformations of the respiratory tree (2 aberrant 
      right upper bronchus and 2 hypoplastic bronchi) were found at TBS. Carinal 
      fistulas in 14 type C patients were occluded by Fogarty catheter to improve 
      ventilation during repair. No complications were observed. Overall, TBS was 
      clinically useful in 28 (45.2%) of 62 patients, including 15 (24.2%) of 62 
      infants in whom it was crucial in modifying the surgical approach. CONCLUSION: 
      Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in 
      tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.

TI  - Is it appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients?
PG  - 286-91
LID - 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181e36dee [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidneys from elderly donors tend to be implanted in recipients who 
      are also elderly. We present the results obtained after 10 years of evolution on 
      transplanting elderly kidneys into young recipients. METHODS: Ninety-one 
      consecutive transplants are studied, carried out in our center with kidneys from 
      cadaver donors older than 60 years implanted in recipients younger than 60 years. 
      The control group is made up of 91 transplants, matched with those from the study 
      group, whose donor and recipient were younger than 60 years. RESULTS: There were 
      no differences between groups with regard to recipient age, sex, cause of death 
      and renal function of the donor, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus serologies, cold 
      ischemia time, tubular necrosis, immediate diuresis, need for dialysis, human 
      leukocyte antigen incompatibilities, hypersensitized patients, acute rejection, 
      waiting time on dialysis, and days of admission. Survival in both groups at 1, 5, 
      and 10 years was 97.6%, 87.2%, and 76.6% vs. 98.8%, 87.5%, and 69.5% for the 
      patient (P=0.642), 92.9%, 81.3%, and 64.2% vs. 93.9%, 76.4%, and 69.5% for the 
      graft (P=0.980), and 94.4%, 92.6%, and 77.4% vs. 94.3%, 86.7%, and 84.4% for the 
      graft with death censured (P=0.747), respectively. Creatininaemias at 1, 5, and 
      10 years were 172, 175, and 210 vs. 139, 134, and 155 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly 
      donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. 
      However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.

TI  - Is muscle power related to running speed with changes of direction?
PG  - 282-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify the relationships between 
      leg muscle power and sprinting speed with changes of direction. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: the study was designed to describe relationships between physical 
      qualities and a component of sports performance. SETTING: testing was conducted 
      in an indoor sports hall and a biomechanics laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 15 male 
      participants were required to be free of injury and have recent experience 
      competing in sports involving sprints with changes of direction. MEASURES: 
      subjects were timed in 8 m sprints in a straight line and with various changes of 
      direction. They were also tested for bilateral and unilateral leg extensor muscle 
      concentric power output by an isokinetic squat and reactive strength by a drop 
      jump. RESULTS: The correlations between concentric power and straight sprinting 
      speed were non-significant whereas the relationships between reactive strength 
      and straight speed were statistically significant. Correlations between muscle 
      power and speed while changing direction were generally low and non-significant 
      for concentric leg power with some moderate and significant (p<0.05) coefficients 
      found for reactive strength. The participants who turned faster to one side 
      tended to have a reactive strength dominance in the leg responsible for the 
      push-off action. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between leg muscle power and 
      change-of-direction speed were not consistent. Reactive strength as measured by 
      the drop jump appears to have some importance for lateral change-of-direction 
      speed, possibly because of similar push-off actions. It was concluded that 
      reactive strength of the leg extensor muscles has some importance in 
      change-of-direction performance but the other technical and perceptual factors 
      than influence agility performance should also be considered.

TI  - Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors 
      in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation?
PG  - 578-86
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate mutations in genes encoding the slow 
      component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) channel in familial 
      atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: Although AF can have a genetic etiology, 
      links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch 
      have not been explored. METHODS: Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, 
      and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant 
      protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological 
      studies and human atrial action potential modeling. RESULTS: One missense KCNQ1 
      mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of 
      hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had 
      developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of 
      wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically 
      significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at 
      baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure 
      to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a 
      marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of 
      activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action 
      potential duration. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation 
      alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a "second 
      hit", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial 
      stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the 
      "first hit"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also 
      account for the age-related increase in AF development.

TI  - Are pelvic anatomical structures in danger during arthroscopic acetabular labral 
      repair? Definition of safe bone depth.
PG  - 45-49
LID - 10.1007/s00167-015-3797-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate safe depth for suture anchor 
      insertion during acetabular labral repair and to determine the neighbouring 
      structures at risk during drilling and anchor insertion. METHODS: Ten human 
      cadaveric hips (six males and four females) were obtained. Acetabular labral 
      surface was prepared and marked for right hips as 12, 1 and 3 o'clock positions, 
      for left hips 12, 11 and 9 o'clock positions. Those were defined as anterior, 
      anterior-superior and superior zones, respectively. These labral positions were 
      drilled at defined zones. After measurements, depth of the bone at 10 degrees  and 20 degrees  
      drill angles on zones was compared statistically. RESULTS: Acetabular bone widths 
      at investigated labral insertion points did not statistically differ. A total of 
      14 injuries in 60 penetrations occurred (23.3 %) with free drill penetrations, 
      and no injuries occurred with stopped drill penetrations. The bone depth was 
      gradually decreasing from 10 degrees  to 20 degrees  drill angles and from anterior to superior 
      inserting zones without significant importance. The risk of perforation to the 
      pelvic cavity started with 20 mm drill depth, and the mean depth for all 
      insertions was calculated as 31.7 mm (SD 2.6). CONCLUSIONS: It is anatomically 
      possible that some pelvic structures sustain iatrogenic injury during acetabular 
      drilling for anchor placement. Being aware of mean pelvic vault is important in 
      which drilling after excessive pincer rim trimming could easily decrease the 
      depth of acetabular bone without a standard. Careful drilling by using stopped 
      drill bit is crucial to prevent iatrogenic injury.

AB  - AIMS: Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) aims to control nerve-sparing total 
      mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer in order to improve patients' 
      functional outcome. This study was designed to compare the urogenital and 
      anorectal functional outcome of TME with and without IONM of innervation to the 
      bladder and the internal anal sphincter. METHODS: A consecutive series of 150 
      patients with primary rectal cancer were analysed. Fifteen match pairs with open 
      TME and combined urogenital and anorectal functional assessment at follow up were 
      established identical regarding gender, tumour site, tumour stage, neoadjuvant 
      radiotherapy and type of surgery. Urogenital and anorectal function was evaluated 
      prospectively on the basis of self-administered standardized questionnaires, 
      measurement of residual urine volume and longterm-catheterization rate. RESULTS: 
      Newly developed urinary dysfunction after surgery was reported by 1 of 15 
      patients in the IONM group and by 6 of 15 in the control group (p = 0.031). 
      Postoperative residual urine volume was significantly higher in the control 
      group. At follow up impaired anorectal function was present in 1 of 15 patients 
      undergoing TME with IONM and in 6 of 15 without IONM (p = 0.031). The IONM group 
      showed a trend towards a lower rate of sexual dysfunction after surgery. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study TME with IONM was associated with significant lower 
      rates of urinary and anorectal dysfunction. Prospective randomized trials are 
      mandatory to evaluate the definite role of IONM in rectal cancer surgery.

TI  - Profiling quality of care: Is there a role for peer review?
PG  - 9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to develop a more reliable structured implicit chart review 
      instrument for use in assessing the quality of care for chronic disease and to 
      examine if ratings are more reliable for conditions in which the evidence base 
      for practice is more developed. METHODS: We conducted a reliability study in a 
      cohort with patient records including both outpatient and inpatient care as the 
      objects of measurement. We developed a structured implicit review instrument to 
      assess the quality of care over one year of treatment. 12 reviewers conducted a 
      total of 496 reviews of 70 patient records selected from 26 VA clinical sites in 
      two regions of the country. Each patient had between one and four conditions 
      specified as having a highly developed evidence base (diabetes and hypertension) 
      or a less developed evidence base (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a 
      collection of acute conditions). Multilevel analysis that accounts for the nested 
      and cross-classified structure of the data was used to estimate the signal and 
      noise components of the measurement of quality and the reliability of implicit 
      review. RESULTS: For COPD and a collection of acute conditions the reliability of 
      a single physician review was quite low (intra-class correlation = 0.16-0.26) but 
      comparable to most previously published estimates for the use of this method in 
      inpatient settings. However, for diabetes and hypertension the reliability is 
      significantly higher at 0.46. The higher reliability is a result of the reviewers 
      collectively being able to distinguish more differences in the quality of care 
      between patients (p < 0.007) and not due to less random noise or individual 
      reviewer bias in the measurement. For these conditions the level of true quality 
      (i.e. the rating of quality of care that would result from the full population of 
      physician reviewers reviewing a record) varied from poor to good across patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, 
      such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess 
      the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method 
      could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches 
      for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like 
      explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which 
      the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course 
      illnesses.

TI  - Multidisciplinary decisions in breast cancer: does the patient receive what the 
      team has recommended?
PG  - 2442-7
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2013.267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach to breast cancer management 
      is the gold standard. The aim is to evaluate MDT decision making in a modern 
      breast unit. METHODS: All referrals to the breast MDT where breast cancer was 
      diagnosed from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011 were included. Multidisciplinary team 
      decisions were compared with subsequent patient management and classified as 
      concordant or discordant. RESULTS: Over the study period, there were 3230 MDT 
      decisions relating to 705 patients. Overall, 91.5% (2956 out of 3230) of 
      decisions were concordant, 4.5% (146 out of 3230), were discordant and 4% (128 
      out of 3230) had no MDT decision. Of 146 discordant decisions, 26 (17.8%) were 
      considered 'unjustifiable' as there was no additional information available after 
      the MDT to account for the change in management. The remaining 120 discordant MDT 
      decisions were considered 'justifiable', as management was altered due to patient 
      choice (n=61), additional information available after MDT (n=54) or MDT error 
      (n=5). CONCLUSION: The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management 
      alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information 
      available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 
      'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is 
      subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.

TI  - Are performance measurement systems useful? Perceptions from health care.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/s12913-017-2022-9 [doi]
LID - 96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior literature identified the use of Performance Measurement 
      Systems (PMS) as crucial in addressing improved processes of care. Moreover, a 
      strategic use of PMS has been found to enhance quality, compared to non-strategic 
      use, although a clear understanding of this linkage is still to be achieved. This 
      paper deals with the test of direct and indirect models related to the link 
      between the strategic use of PMS and the level of improved processes in health 
      care organizations. Indirect models were mediated by the degree of perceived 
      managerial discretion. METHODS: A PLS analysis on a survey of 97 Italian managers 
      working for health care organizations in the Lombardy region was conducted. The 
      response rate was 77.6%. RESULTS: The strategic use of PMS in health care 
      organizations directly and significantly (p < 0.001) enhances performance in 
      terms of improved processes. Perceived managerial discretion is positively and 
      significantly (p < 0.001) affected by the strategic use of PMS, whereas the 
      mediation effect is non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the 
      literature investigating the design and implementation of a non-financial 
      measurement tool, such as the non-financial information included into a balanced 
      scorecard (BSC), in health care organizations. Managers in health care 
      organizations can benefit from the strategic use of PMS to effectively allocate 
      their time to strategic opportunities and threats, which might arise and affect 
      organizational, output-related performance, such as improving processes.

TI  - The colour of pain: can patients use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain?
PG  - 34-46
LID - 10.1002/msc.1048 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to explore patients' views on the 
      acceptability and feasibility of using colour to describe osteoarthritis (OA) 
      pain, and whether colour could be used to communicate pain to healthcare 
      professionals. METHODS: Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with 
      knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to 
      describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how 
      colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether 
      they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals. 
      RESULTS: The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour 
      was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing 
      their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity 
      pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and 
      the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence 
      of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional 
      feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen 
      to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified 
      as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was 
      described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants 
      thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to 
      healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and 
      standardization of colour were raised. CONCLUSIONS: For some patients, using 
      colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve 
      doctor-patient communication.

TI  - Do mossy fibers release GABA?
PG  - 196-202
AB  - PURPOSE: Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus 
      granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal 
      circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been 
      implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in 
      the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, 
      zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense 
      immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid 
      (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present 
      physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by 
      epileptic activity. METHODS: We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old 
      guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal 
      cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their 
      position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections. RESULTS: We have 
      shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit 
      monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. 
      These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 
      synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists, 
      facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
      receptor-independent long-term potentiation. CONCLUSIONS: We have thus provided 
      compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic 
      role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of 
      developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is 
      transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or 
      disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.

TI  - Is severe macrosomia manifested at 11-14 weeks of gestation?
PG  - 740-3
LID - 10.1002/uog.5310 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between fetal biometry in the first or 
      early second trimester and severe macrosomia at delivery. METHODS: This 
      case-control study included 30 term severely macrosomic neonates; 90 
      appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates served as controls. All 
      pregnancies underwent nuchal translucency (NT) screening at 11-14 weeks' 
      gestation. Pregnancies were dated by accurate last menstrual period consistent 
      with crown-rump length (CRL) measurements at the time of screening, early 
      pregnancy CRL or date of fertilization. The association between birth weight and 
      the difference between the measured and the expected CRL at the time of NT 
      screening was analyzed. RESULTS: The difference between measured and expected 
      CRL, expressed both in mm and in days of gestation, was statistically greater in 
      the severely macrosomic neonates compared with controls (mean, 6.66 +/- 4.78 mm 
      vs. 1.17 +/- 4.6 mm, P < 0.0001 and 3 +/- 2.2 days vs. 0.5 +/- 2.3 days, P < 
      0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant correlations between 
      the extent of macrosomia and the discrepancy between expected and measured fetal 
      size at the time of NT screening (r = 0.47, P < 0.01 and r = 0.48, P < 0.01, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Severe macrosomia apparently manifests as early as 
      11-14 weeks' gestation.

      visceral adipose tissue volume?
PG  - 20170253
LID - 10.1259/bjr.20170253 [doi]
LID - 20170253
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Measurement of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) needs to be accurate and 
      sensitive to change for risk monitoring. The purpose of this study is to 
      determine the CT slice location where VAT area can best reflect changes in VAT 
      volume and body weight. METHODS: 60 plain abdominal CT images from 30 males [mean 
      age (range) 51 (41-68) years, mean body weight (range) 71.1 (101.9-50.9) kg] who 
      underwent workplace screenings twice within a 1-year interval were evaluated. 
      Automatically calculated and manually corrected areas of the VAT of various scan 
      levels using "freeform curve" region of interest on CT were recorded and compared 
      with body weight changes. RESULTS: The strongest correlations of VAT area with 
      VAT volume and body weight changes were shown in a slice 3 cm above the lower 
      margin of L3 with r values of 0.853 and 0.902, respectively. CONCLUSION: VAT area 
      measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is 
      feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in 
      knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best 
      reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement 
      should be selected at this location.

TI  - Is an advance care planning model feasible in community palliative care? A 
      multi-site action research approach.
PG  - 2021-33
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05892.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This article reports a study to determine the feasibility of an advance care 
      planning model developed with Australian community palliative care services. 
      BACKGROUND: An effective advance care planning programme involves an 
      organizational wide commitment and preparedness for health service reform to 
      embed advance care planning into routine practice. Internationally, such 
      programmes have been implemented predominantly in aged and acute care with more 
      recent work in primary care. METHODS: A multi-site action research was conducted 
      over a 16-month period in 2007-2009 with three Victorian community palliative 
      care services. Using mixed method data collection strategies to assess 
      feasibility, we conducted a baseline audit of staff and clients; analysed 
      relevant documents (client records, policies, procedures and quality improvement 
      strategies) pre-implementation and post-implementation and conducted key 
      informant interviews (n = 9). SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Three community 
      palliative care services: one regional and two metropolitan services in Victoria, 
      Australia. RESULTS: The services demonstrated that it was feasible to embed the 
      Model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations 
      and involvement of family was an important outcome measure rather than completion 
      rate of advance care planning documents in community settings. Services adapted 
      and applied their own concept of community, which widened the impact of the 
      model. Changes to quality audit processes were essential to consolidate the model 
      into routine palliative care practice. CONCLUSION: An advance care planning model 
      is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are 
      an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning 
      discussion established as an important outcome measure.

TI  - Do cytokines have any role in epilepsy?
PG  - 171-6
LID - 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2008.07.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed cytokines levels in patients with epilepsy and new onset 
      seizure and correlated it with various parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 
      obtaining consent, serum samples from 100 patients with epilepsy or new onset 
      seizure were prospectively collected in the immediate post-ictal phase. In 16 
      patients, a second sample was collected during the seizure-free period. The serum 
      cytokine levels [TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6] were 
      assessed (ELISA) in these patients and 100 matched healthy controls. CSF analysis 
      was carried out in 9 patients of this cohort, when clinically indicated. RESULTS: 
      The type of seizures (n=100) was major (45), partial (41) and status epilepticus 
      (SE=14), while the epilepsy syndromes were idiopathic generalized (53) and 
      localization related (47). The detectable serum cytokines in the patient group 
      (n=100) were: IL-6 (42), TNF-alpha (36), IL-2 (22), IL-4 (22), IFN-gamma (20) and 
      IL-1 (11) compared to the controls. CSF IL-6 and IL-1 was detectable in 4/9 and 
      2/9 patients, respectively while, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma was detectable 1 in each 
      patient. Correlations were noted between male gender and IL-1beta (p=0.04), 
      positive family history and IL-1beta (p=0.001), "no alcohol use" and TNF-alpha 
      (p=0.05), more than one year history of epilepsy and IL-1beta (p=0.02), status 
      epilepticus (SE) and IL-6 (p=0.04). There was no difference between the new onset 
      seizures vs. epilepsy group. Serial analysis during the seizure-free period 
      revealed a decrease in cytokine levels: TNF-alpha (25% to 12.5%), IFN-gamma 
      (12.5% to 0%), IL-1 (25% to 0) and IL-2 (6.2% to 6.2%), IL-4 (18.8% to 0%) and 
      IL-6 (18.8% to 6.2%). CONCLUSIONS: We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine 
      levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.

TI  - Is expert breast pathology assessment necessary for the management of ductal 
      carcinoma in situ ?
PG  - 265-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines include a recommendation that a pathologist with 
      expertise in breast disease review all ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) specimens 
      due to the presence of significant variability in pathologic reporting of DCIS. 
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of 
      pathologic reporting of DCIS over the past decade and to determine the current 
      impact of expert breast pathology assessment on the management of DCIS. METHODS: 
      All patients with a diagnosis of DCIS referred to a single regional cancer centre 
      between 1982 and 2000 have been reviewed. Inter-observer variability between 
      initial and secondary reports has been evaluated using kappa statistics. For each 
      case, the Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) using pathologic data obtained from 
      the initial and reviewed pathology reports were compared. The impact of expert 
      breast pathology on risk assessment and treatment was determined. RESULTS: 481 
      individuals with DCIS were referred and pathology review was performed on 350 
      patients (73%). Inter-observer agreement was high for the main pathologic 
      features of DCIS. From 1996 to 2000, secondary pathology assessments lead to a 
      change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 100 cases (29%) and 
      contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 93 (43%) cases. 
      CONCLUSION: Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the 
      management of DCIS.

TI  - Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak 
      oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake?
PG  - 679-87
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20080328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have demonstrated low peak oxygen uptake 
      ((.)Vo(2)peak) in children with spina bifida. Low peak heart rate and low peak 
      respiratory exchange ratio in these studies raised questions regarding the true 
      maximal character of (.)Vo(2)peak values obtained with treadmill testing. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the Vo(2)peak measured 
      during an incremental treadmill test is a true reflection of the maximum oxygen 
      uptake ((.)Vo(2)max) in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory. 
      DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used for this study. METHODS: Twenty 
      children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak 
      was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of 
      (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines 
      for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences 
      between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol 
      ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal). RESULTS: The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and 
      normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 
      mL/kg/min (SD=8.3). Fifteen children met at least 2 of the 3 previously described 
      criteria; one child failed to meet any criteria. Although there were no 
      significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and Vo(2)supramaximal, 5 children 
      did show improvement during supramaximal testing. LIMITATIONS: These results 
      apply to children who have spina bifida and are at least community ambulatory. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The (.)Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test seems 
      to reflect the true (.)Vo(2)max in children who have spina bifida and are 
      ambulatory, validating the use of a treadmill test for these children. When 
      confirmation of maximal effort is needed, the addition of supramaximal testing of 
      children with disability is an easy and well-tolerated method.

TI  - Subclavian steal syndrome: can the blood pressure difference between arms predict 
      the severity of steal?
PG  - 131-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial 
      blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is 
      frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). It was 
      the goal of this retrospective study to investigate the relationship between 
      different vertebral artery waveform types and the side-to-side difference in 
      systolic blood pressure in patients with sonographically proven SSS. METHODS: The 
      records of 1860 patients from the Neuroultrasound Laboratory between January 2000 
      and December 2000 were screened for the diagnosis of SSS in the final ultrasound 
      report. In all patients, bilateral brachial arterial blood pressure was measured 
      in a sitting position prior to the ultrasound examination. Vertebral artery 
      waveforms were classified as (1) systolic deceleration, (2) alternating flow, and 
      (3) complete reversal at rest. Blood pressure difference as calculated by 
      normal-side blood pressure minus lesion-side blood pressure was compared with the 
      3 Doppler waveform types. RESULTS: SSS was found in 51 of 1860 (2.7%) 
      ultrasonography studies of 49 patients (17 men, 32 women; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.5 
      years). Two patients (4%) had bilateral SSS. In 3 patients (6%), SSS was related 
      to an innominate artery stenosis. Waveform analysis showed a completely reversed 
      flow in 16 (31%), an alternating flow in 24 (47%), and a systolic deceleration in 
      11 (22%) cases. Systolic blood pressure difference was significantly higher in 
      the complete reversal and alternating groups than in the systolic deceleration 
      group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is 
      related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. 
      However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.

TI  - Is size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement an option in 
      modern aortic surgery?
PG  - 614-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enlargement of the ascending aorta is often combined with valvular, 
      coronary, or other cardiac diseases. Reduction aortoplasty can be an optional 
      therapy; however, indications regarding the diameter of aorta, the history of 
      dilatation (poststenosis, bicuspid aortic valve), or the intraoperative 
      management (wall excision, reduction suture, external reinforcement) are not 
      established. METHODS: In a retrospective study between 1997 and 2005, we 
      investigated 531 patients operated for aneurysm or ectasia of the ascending aorta 
      (diameter: 45-76mm). Of these, in 50 patients, size-reducing ascending 
      aortoplasty was performed. External reinforcement with a non-coated dacron 
      prosthesis was added in order to stabilize the aortic wall. RESULTS: Aortoplasty 
      was associated with aortic valve replacement in 47 cases (35 mechanical vs 12 
      biological), subvalvular myectomy in 29 cases, and CABG in 13 cases. The 
      procedure was performed with low hospital mortality (2%) and a low postoperative 
      morbidity. Computertomographic and echocardiographic diameters were significantly 
      smaller after reduction (55.8+/-9mm down to 40.51+/-6.2mm (CT), p<0.002; 
      54.1+/-6.7mm preoperatively down to 38.7+/-7.1mm (echocardiography), p<0.002), 
      with stable performance in long-term follow-up (mean follow-up time: 70 months). 
      CONCLUSIONS: As demonstrated in this study, size reduction of the ascending aorta 
      using aortoplasty with external reinforcement is a safe procedure with excellent 
      long-term results. It is a therapeutic option in modern aortic surgery in 
      patients with poststenotic dilatation of the aorta without impairment of the 
      sinotubular junction of the aortic valve and root.

TI  - Is digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate 
      cancer?
PG  - 97-102
LID - 10.1002/pros.22733 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Digoxin is a commonly used medication for heart failure and cardiac 
      arrhythmias that has recently been suggested as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. 
      Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with 
      digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk. 
      METHODS: Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 
      35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were 
      available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched 
      by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding 
      medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk 
      was evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS: One thousand one cases of PCa 
      and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 
      2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis 
      adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use 
      was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 
      0.30-1.10). Among those with >/=3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 
      380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk 
      (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98). CONCLUSION: These data indicate digoxin use may be 
      associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by 
      which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies 
      showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is 
      warranted.

TI  - Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus: are the criteria proposed by the 
      international association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups 
      cost-effective?
PG  - 529-35
LID - 10.2337/dc11-1643 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study 
      Groups (IADPSG) recently recommended new criteria for diagnosing gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study was undertaken to determine whether adopting 
      the IADPSG criteria would be cost-effective, compared with the current standard 
      of care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a decision analysis model 
      comparing the cost-utility of three strategies to identify GDM: 1) no screening, 
      2) current screening practice (1-h 50-g glucose challenge test between 24 and 28 
      weeks followed by 3-h 100-g glucose tolerance test when indicated), or 3) 
      screening practice proposed by the IADPSG. Assumptions included that 1) women 
      diagnosed with GDM received additional prenatal monitoring, mitigating the risks 
      of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and birth injury; and 2) GDM women had 
      opportunity for intensive postdelivery counseling and behavior modification to 
      reduce future diabetes risks. The primary outcome measure was the incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Our model demonstrates that the IADPSG 
      recommendations are cost-effective only when postdelivery care reduces diabetes 
      incidence. For every 100,000 women screened, 6,178 quality-adjusted life-years 
      (QALYs) are gained, at a cost of $125,633,826. The ICER for the IADPSG strategy 
      compared with the current standard was $20,336 per QALY gained. When postdelivery 
      care was not accomplished, the IADPSG strategy was no longer cost-effective. 
      These results were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The IADPSG 
      recommendation for glucose screening in pregnancy is cost-effective. The model is 
      most sensitive to the likelihood of preventing future diabetes in patients 
      identified with GDM using postdelivery counseling and intervention.

TI  - Does a 4 diagram manual enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme(R)? 
      A pilot study in the manikin.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/1757-7241-20-21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bystander resuscitation plays an important role in lifesaving 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the 
      "no-flow-time", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality 
      of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices 
      (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons 
      to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to 
      determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables 
      laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme(R) (LMAS) in the manikin. METHODS: 
      An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the 
      correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a 
      LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the 
      instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as 
      displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. 
      RESULTS: A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) 
      inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted 
      inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized 
      this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) 
      applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 
      150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 +/- 
      29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), 
      technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25). 
      CONCLUSION: In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction 
      after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This 
      indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in 
      principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected 
      (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs 
      may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.

TI  - Is laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery feasible?
PG  - 733-7
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Laparoscopic techniques can be used to treat patients whose 
      antireflux surgery has failed. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Two academic medical 
      centers. PATIENTS: Forty-six consecutive patients, of whom 21 were male and 25 
      were female (mean age, 55.6 years; range, 15-80 years). Previous antireflux 
      procedures were laparoscopic (21 patients), laparotomy (21 patients), thoracotomy 
      (3 patients), and thoracoscopy (1 patient). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The cause of 
      failure, operative and postoperative morbidity, and the level of follow-up 
      satisfaction were determined for all patients. RESULTS: The causes of failure 
      were hiatal herniation (31 patients [67%]), fundoplication breakdown (20 patients 
      [43%]), fundoplication slippage (9 patients [20%]), tight fundoplication (5 
      patients [11%]), misdiagnosed achalasia (2 patients [4%]), and displaced 
      Angelchik prosthesis (2 patients [4%]). Twenty-two patients (48%) had more than 1 
      cause. Laparoscopic reoperative procedures were Nissen fundoplication (n = 22), 
      Toupet fundoplication (n = 13), paraesophageal hernia repair (n = 4), Dor 
      procedure (n = 2), Angelchik prosthesis removal (n = 2), Heller myotomy (n = 2), 
      and the takedown of a wrap (n = 1). In addition, 18 patients required crural 
      repair and 13 required paraesophageal hernia repair. The mean +/- SEM duration of 
      surgery was 3.5+/-1.1 hours. Operative complications were fundus tear (n = 8), 
      significant bleeding (n = 4), bougie perforation (n = 1), small bowel enterotomy 
      (n = 1), and tension pneumothorax (n = 1). The conversion rate (from laparoscopic 
      to an open procedure) was 20% overall (9 patients) but 0% in the last 10 
      patients. Mortality was 0%. The mean +/- SEM hospital stay was 2.3+/-0.9 days for 
      operations completed laparoscopically. Follow-up was possible in 35 patients 
      (76%) at 17.2+/-11.8 months. The well-being score (1 best; 10, worst) was 
      8.6+/-2.1 before and 2.9+/-2.4 after surgery (P<.001). Thirty-one (89%) of 35 
      patients were satisfied with their decision to have reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Antireflux surgery failures are most commonly associated with hiatal herniation, 
      followed by the breakdown of the fundoplication. The laparoscopic approach may be 
      used successfully to treat patients with failed antireflux operations. Good 
      results were achieved despite the technical difficulty of the procedures.

TI  - The Omega-3 Index: a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease?
PG  - 212-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic 
      acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from 
      coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or 
      fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of 
      about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects 
      long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter 
      called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD. 
      METHODS: We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data 
      necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The 
      relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially 
      sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and 
      secondary prevention studies. RESULTS: The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated 
      with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of > or = 8% was associated with 
      the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of < or = 4% was associated with 
      the least. CONCLUSION: The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically 
      relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD 
      that could have significant clinical utility.

TI  - Do cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice predict the presence of pancreatic 
      diseases?
PG  - 782-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cytokine concentration in pancreatic juice of patients with 
      pancreatic disease is unknown. Secretin stimulation allows endoscopic collection 
      of pancreatic juice secreted into the duodenum. We aimed to evaluate the cytokine 
      concentrations in pancreatic juice of patients with abdominal pain to 
      discriminate presence from absence of pancreatic disease. METHODS: From January 
      2003-December 2004, consecutive patients with abdominal pain compatible with 
      pancreatic origin were enrolled. Patients underwent upper endoscopy. Intravenous 
      secretin (0.2 mug/kg) was given immediately before scope intubation. Pancreatic 
      juice collected from the duodenum was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen 
      until assays were performed. Pancreatic juice levels of interleukin-8, 
      interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and transforming growth 
      factor-beta 1 were measured by modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The 
      final diagnosis was made by the primary gastroenterologist on the basis of 
      medical history; laboratory, endoscopic, and imaging studies; and clinical 
      follow-up. Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for 
      statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of 130 patients screened, 118 met the inclusion 
      criteria. Multivariate analysis revealed that only interleukin-8 was able to 
      discriminate between normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis (P = .011), 
      pancreatic cancer (P = .044), and the presence of pancreatic diseases (P = .007). 
      Individual cytokine concentrations were not significantly different in chronic 
      pancreatitis compared with pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine levels can be 
      measured in pancreatic juice obtained from the duodenum without direct 
      cannulation of the pancreatic duct. Interleukin-8 concentration in pancreatic 
      juice can be used to discriminate between normal pancreas and patients with 
      pancreatic disease. This is a relatively simple and noninvasive method to aid in 
      the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.

TI  - Factors determining the survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with lung metastasis 
      alone: does combined modality treatment benefit?
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-11-370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with lung metastasis alone has been 
      reported as a relatively favorable prognostic group, and combined modality 
      treatment might be indicated for selected cases. However, the prognostic factors 
      determining survival of this group and the indication of combined therapy have 
      not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 246 patients of 
      NPC with lung metastasis(es) alone presented at diagnosis or as the first failure 
      after primary treatment from 1993 to 2008 in an academic tertiary hospital. 
      Univariate and multivariate survival analyses of post-metastasis survival (PMS) 
      and overall survival (OS) were carried out to determine the prognostic factors. 
      RESULTS: The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year of PMS and OS for the whole cohort were 
      34.3%, 17.0%, 8.6% and 67.8%, 45.4%, 18.5%, respectively. The median PMS (45.6 
      months vs. 23.7 months) and OS (73.7 months vs. 46.2 months) of patients treated 
      with combined therapy was significantly longer than that of those treated with 
      chemotherapy alone (P < 0.001). Age, disease-free interval (DFI) and treatment 
      modality were evaluated as independent prognostic factors of OS, while only age 
      and treatment modality retain their independent significance in PMS analysis. In 
      stratified survival analysis, compared to chemotherapy alone, combined therapy 
      could benefit the patients with DFI > 1 year, but not those with DFI </= 1 year. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Age </= 45 years, DFI > 1 year, and the combined therapy were good 
      prognostic factors for NPC patients with lung metastasis(es) alone. The 
      combination of local therapy and the basic chemotherapy should be considered for 
      these patients with DFI > 1 year.

TI  - Is minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords reproducible and 
      applicable in routine surgery?
PG  - 707-11
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivv065 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Traditional resectional techniques and chordal transfer are difficult 
      to apply in video-assisted mitral valve repair. Using artificial chords appears 
      easier in this setting. The purpose of this study was to review the effectiveness 
      and reproducibility of neochordal repair as a routine approach to minimally 
      invasive mitral repair, and to assess the stability of neochord implantation 
      using the figure-of-eight suture without pledgets in this setting. METHODS: This 
      is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent minimally invasive 
      video-assisted mitral valve repair from 2008 to 2013. The primary endpoints were 
      recurrent mitral regurgitation and reoperation. RESULTS: A total of 426 
      consecutive patients were included during the study period, with a mean age of 55 
      +/- 18 years. Neochords were used in all patients, and in association with leaflet 
      resection in 47 patients. One patient was not repairable and underwent valve 
      replacement (repair rate, 99.8%). Fifteen patients had Grade I (3.5%) 
      regurgitation, whereas the remainder had none. Patients were fast-tracked, with 
      25% extubated in the operation theatre and the remainder within 6 h. There were 5 
      deaths within 30 days (1.2%). Follow-up ranged 3-60 months, during which all of 
      the patients remained with no or trace mitral regurgitation. No de-insertion or 
      rupture of any neochords was found, and no patients required a reoperation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a 
      high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting 
      and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for 
      mitral valve surgery.

TI  - Does receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improve the management of pain at 
      the end of life?
PG  - 507-15
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare analgesic management of daily pain for dying nursing home 
      residents enrolled and not enrolled in Medicare hospice. DESIGN: Retrospective, 
      comparative cohort study. SETTING: Over 800 nursing homes in Kansas, Maine, 
      Mississippi, New York, and South Dakota. PARTICIPANTS: A subset of residents with 
      daily pain near the end of life taken from a matched cohort of hospice (2,644) 
      and nonhospice (7,929) nursing home residents who had at least two resident 
      assessments (Minimum Data Sets (MDSs)) completed, their last between 1992 and 
      1996, and who died before April 1997. The daily pain subset consisted of 709 
      hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents. MEASUREMENTS: Detailed drug use data 
      contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management 
      of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) 
      were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain 
      in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, 
      examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not 
      recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain 
      (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS). RESULTS: Fifteen percent of hospice 
      residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics 
      (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower 
      proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received 
      analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80). Overall, 
      acetaminophen (not in combination with other drugs) was used most frequently for 
      nonhospice residents (25% of 1,673 prescriptions), whereas morphine derivatives 
      were used most frequently for hospice residents (30% of 1,058 prescriptions). 
      Fifty-one percent of hospice residents and 33% of nonhospice residents received 
      regular treatment for daily pain. Controlling for clinical confounders, hospice 
      residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular 
      treatment for daily pain (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56). 
      CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better 
      for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in 
      hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying 
      nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are 
      receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management 
      guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is 
      essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.

TI  - Is intensive chemotherapy safe for rural cancer patients?
PG  - 643-9
LID - 10.1111/imj.12083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To provide equality of cancer care to rural patients, Townsville 
      Cancer Centre administers intensive chemotherapy regimens to rural patients with 
      node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban 
      patients. Side-effects were usually managed by rural general practitioners 
      locally. AIM: The aim is to determine the safety of this practice by comparing 
      the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and 
      rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre. METHOD: A retrospective audit was 
      conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers 
      during a 24-month period. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis. Rurality was 
      determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification. RESULTS: Of the 
      121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and colon cancers 
      respectively. The urban versus rural patient split among all patients, breast and 
      colorectal cancer subgroups was 68 versus 53, 43 versus 27 and 25 versus 26 
      respectively. A total of 421 cycles was given with dose intensity of >95% for 
      breast cancer in both groups (P > 0.05). Rate of febrile neutropenia was 9.3% 
      versus 7.4% (P = 0.56). For XELOX, rate of diarrhoea was 20% versus 19% (P = 
      0.66) and rate of vomiting was 20% versus 11% (P = 0.11). Only two patients were 
      transferred to Townsville for admission. No toxic death occurred in either group. 
      CONCLUSION: It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at 
      standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. 
      Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce 
      the safety concerns.

TI  - Is the urinary biomarkers assessment a non-invasive approach to tubular lesions 
      of the solitary kidney?
PG  - 1358-64
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2013.828367 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The solitary kidney (SK) is currently debated in the literature, as 
      living kidney donation is extensively used and the diagnosis of congenital SK is 
      frequent. Tubulointerstitial lesions associated with adaptive phenomena may occur 
      early within the SK. AIMS: Analysis of the significance of urinary biomarkers in 
      the assessment of tubulointerstitial lesions of the SK. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study of 37 patients with SK included 18 patients-acquired SK 
      (mean age 56.44 +/- 12.20 years, interval from nephrectomy 10.94 +/- 9.37 years), 19 
      patients-congenital SK (mean age 41.52 +/- 10.54 years). Urinary NAG, urinary 
      alpha-1-microglobulin, albuminuria, eGFR (CKD-EPI equation) were measured. 
      RESULTS: In acquired SK, NAG increased in 60.66%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin 
      in 16.66%, albuminuria in 55.55% of patients. Inverse correlation with eGFR 
      presented NAG (R(2 )= 0.537, p = 0.022), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin 
      (R(2 )= 0.702, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.655, p = 0.003). In congenital 
      SK, NAG increased in 52.63%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 5.26%, albuminuria 
      in 47.36% of patients. In this group, urinary biomarkers correlated inversely 
      with eGFR: NAG (R(2 )= 0.743, p < 0.001), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin 
      (R(2 )= 0.701, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.821, p < 0.001). Significant 
      correlations were found between the urinary biomarkers in both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Urinary biomarkers allow a non-invasive, sensitive, early assessment 
      of the tubular lesions of the SK. Urinary biomarkers of PT injury parallel renal 
      function decline, thus complementing the estimation of GFR. Monitoring of PT 
      dysfunction is mandatory in patients with SK.

TI  - Does open access endoscopy close the door to an adequately informed patient?
PG  - 212-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of open access endoscopy is increasing. Its effect on the 
      adequacy of patient informed consent, procedure acceptance and the impact on 
      subsequent communication/transfer of procedure results to the patient have not 
      been evaluated. The aim of our study was to compare the extent of preknowledge of 
      procedures and test explanation, patient medical complexity, information transfer 
      and overall patient satisfaction between a patient group referred for outpatient 
      open access endoscopy versus a patient group from a gastrointestinal (GI) 
      subspecialty clinic. METHODS: Information was obtained from all patients 
      presenting for outpatient upper and lower endoscopy by using a 1-page 
      questionnaire. Patients from the two groups who had an outpatient upper/lower 
      endoscopic procedure were contacted by phone after the procedure to obtain 
      information with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: The open access patients 
      reported receiving significantly less information to help them identify the 
      procedure (p < 0.01) and less explanation concerning the nature of the procedure 
      than the group of patients referred from the subspecialty clinic (p < 0.005). 
      There was no difference between the two groups in satisfaction scores for 
      examinations performed under conscious sedation. For flexible sigmoidoscopy 
      without sedation, however, the GI clinic patient group were more satisfied with 
      their procedure. The majority of patients, regardless of access, were more likely 
      to receive endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist than the referring 
      physician. Furthermore, the patients in the GI clinic group who underwent 
      colonoscopy felt significantly better at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients 
      undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about 
      their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, 
      a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results 
      to the patient.

TI  - Do viral infections have a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo?
PG  - 211-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of viral infection in benign paroxysmal 
      positional vertigo (BPPV). METHODS: In this retrospective study, 483 patients 
      with BPPV were included in the study group. The control group consisted of 461 
      healthy subjects. In both groups, serologic analysis of viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, 
      Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) was 
      performed. RESULTS: With the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, all viral 
      serology values were higher in the BBPV group than the control group. We also 
      observed seasonal variation. The BPPV group exhibited elevated values for HSV1 
      and adenovirus in March and May, for Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in 
      April, for HSV1 in June, and for HSV1 and CMV in September, compared to the 
      control group. In October, the BPPV group showed increased values for all of the 
      viruses studied, compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: BPPV is associated 
      with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, 
      mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to 
      the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral 
      infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.

TI  - Does reducing spasticity translate into functional benefit? An exploratory 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1547-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spasticity and loss of function in an affected arm are common after 
      stroke. Although botulinum toxin is used to reduce spasticity, its functional 
      benefits are less easily demonstrated. This paper reports an exploratory 
      meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between reduced arm spasticity and 
      improved arm function. METHOD: Individual data from stroke patients in two 
      randomised controlled trials of intra-muscular botulinum toxin were pooled. The 
      Modified Ashworth Scale (elbow, wrist, fingers) was used to calculate a 
      "Composite Spasticity Index". Data from the arm section of the Barthel Activities 
      of Daily Living Index (dressing, grooming, and feeding) and three subjective 
      measures (putting arm through sleeve, cleaning palm, cutting fingernails) were 
      summed to give a "Composite Functional Index". Change scores and the time of 
      maximum change were also calculated. RESULTS: Maximum changes in both composite 
      measures occurred concurrently in 47 patients. In 26 patients the improvement in 
      spasticity preceded the improvement in function with 18 showing the reverse. 
      There was a definite relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and 
      the maximum change in arm function, independent of treatment (rho = -0.2822, p = 
      0.0008, n = 137). There was a clear relationship between the changes in 
      spasticity and in arm function in patients treated with botulinum toxin (Dysport) 
      at 500 or 1000 units (rho = -0.5679, p = 0.0090, n = 22; rho = -0.4430, p = 
      0.0018, n = 47), but not in those treated with placebo or 1500 units. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using a targeted meta-analytic approach, it is possible to 
      demonstrate that reducing spasticity in the arm is associated with a significant 
      improvement in arm function.

TI  - Is the Retromandibular Transparotid Approach a Reliable Option for the Surgical 
      Treatment of Condylar Fractures?

LID - S0278-2391(16)30945-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.joms.2016.10.003 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the outcomes and complications of the surgical 
      treatment of condylar fractures by the retromandibular transparotid approach. The 
      authors hypothesized that such an approach would be safe and reliable for the 
      treatment of most condylar fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective 
      evaluation of patients who underwent surgical reduction of a condylar fracture 
      from January 2012 to December 2014 at the Clinic of Dentistry and Maxillofacial 
      Surgery of the University Hospital of Verona (Verona, Italy) was performed. 
      Inclusion criteria were having undergone surgical treatment of condylar fractures 
      with a retromandibular transparotid approach and the availability of computed 
      tomograms of the preoperative and postoperative facial skeleton with a minimum 
      follow-up of 1 year. Static and dynamic occlusal function, temporomandibular 
      joint health status, presence of neurologic impairments, and esthetic outcomes 
      were evaluated in all patients. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 25 patients. 
      Preinjury occlusion and temporomandibular joint health were restored in most 
      patients. Esthetic outcomes were deemed satisfactory by clinicians and patients. 
      Neither permanent neurologic impairments nor major postoperative complications 
      were observed. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of the present study, the 
      retromandibular transparotid approach is a viable and safe approach for the 
      surgical treatment of condylar fractures.

TI  - Do ventricular arrhythmias in athletes subside over time?
PG  - 485-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is 
      presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 
      long-term follow-up ofathletes with ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise 
      test. METHODS: From a database of 56,462 athletes we identified 192 athletes (35 
      years old who had ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise test. Ninety 
      athletes had > or =3 ventricular premature beats (VPB) (group A) and 102 athletes 
      had ventricular couplets or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during an 
      exercise test (group B). A control group of 92 athletesfrom without ventricular 
      arrhythmias was randomly seleclted from the database (group C). Of the 192 
      athletes 39 returnied for a repeat exercise test after a mean follow-up period of 
      70 +/- 25 months and they constitute the study population. RESULTS: Twelve 
      athletes from group A, 21 fromgroup B and 6 from group C returned for a repeat 
      exercise test. The athletes reached a significantly lower peak heart rate during 
      their follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). More athletes were engaged in 
      competitive sports during their initialexercise test than in the follow-up test 
      (P = 0.021). Most of theathletes who had VPB and/orventricular couplets and/or 
      NSVT during their initial exercise test had far fewer ventricular arrhythmias in 
      the follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Athletes engaged in 
      competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during 
      exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in 
      non-competitive sports.

TI  - Are complex coronary lesions more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus?
PG  - 935-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary atherosclerotic burden is excessive in diabetic patients. 
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent predictor for both death and myocardial 
      infarction. It is not known whether the prevalence of complex coronary lesions, 
      such as bifurcation and ostial lesions, is different in diabetics from 
      nondiabetics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of present study was to investigate the 
      prevalence of these lesions in patients with DM. METHODS: One thousand fourteen 
      consecutive patients (mean age 61.3+/-10.7 years) were investigated. Coronary 
      angiograms were examined for bifurcation and ostial lesions using a digital 
      quantitative system. Patients were classified as diabetic (n=281) or nondiabetic 
      (n=733). RESULTS: Patient mean age, and rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia 
      were significantly higher in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group 
      (P<0.0001), although smoking was significantly lower (P=0.001). Reasons for 
      coronary angiography and treatment were comparable between the two groups. The 
      prevalence of bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions was significantly greater in 
      the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (9.8% versus 4.3% [P=0.001] and 
      38.4% versus 29.2% [P=0.003] in the diabetic group versus the nondiabetic group). 
      The presence of DM and greater age were found to be independent predictors for 
      bifurcation lesions (OR=2.27 [P=0.004] and OR=1.03 [P=0.01], for DM and age, 
      respectively) and ostial lesions (OR=1.40 [P=0.027] and OR=1.02 [P=0.001], for DM 
      and age, respectively) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Complex coronary 
      lesions such as bifurcation and ostial lesions were significantly more common in 
      diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. Greater age and the presence of 
      DM were independent predictors for these complex lesions. These results may help 
      to explain the poor prognosis of coronary artery disease among diabetic patients.

TI  - Can dogs prime autistic children for therapy? Evidence from a single case study.
PG  - 655-9
LID - 10.1089/acm.2010.0436 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Canine-assisted therapy has been receiving growing 
      attention as a means of aiding children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, 
      only limited studies have been done and a great deal of literature related to 
      this intervention is anecdotal. The present study aims at providing additional 
      quantitative evidence on the potential of dogs to positively modulate the 
      behavior of children with ASD. SETTINGS/LOCATION, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: A 
      12-year-old boy diagnosed with ASD was exposed, at his usual treatment location 
      (the Portuguese Association for Developmental Disorders and Autism at Vila Nova 
      de Gaia, Portugal), to the following treatment conditions: (1) one-to-one 
      structured activities with a therapist assisted by a certified therapy dog, and 
      (2) one-to-one structured activities with the same therapist alone (as a 
      control). To accurately assess differences in the behavior of the participant 
      between these treatment conditions, the therapist followed a strict research 
      protocol. The behavior of the participant was continuously video-recorded during 
      both treatment conditions for further analysis and comparison. Treatment 
      outcomes: In the presence of the dog, the participant exhibited more frequent and 
      longer durations of positive behaviors (such as smiling and positive physical 
      contacting) as well as less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors 
      (such as aggressive manifestations). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are in 
      accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the 
      assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this 
      study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted 
      therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar 
      research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to 
      work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through 
      canine-assisted interventions.

TI  - Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter?
PG  - 19
AB  - BACKGROUND: As part of a prospective study on quality of life in newly diagnosed 
      lung cancer patients an investigation was carried out to examine whether there 
      were differences among patients' quality of life scores and their socioeconomic 
      status. METHODS: Quality of life was measured at two points in time (baseline and 
      three months after initial treatment) using three standard instruments; the 
      Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the European Organization for Research and 
      Cancer Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its lung 
      cancer supplement (QLQ-LC13). Socioeconomic status for each individual patient 
      was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least 
      deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their 
      address. RESULTS: In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of 
      these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of 
      patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, 
      less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, 
      physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), 
      physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant 
      at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference 
      between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge. CONCLUSION: At 
      baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health 
      related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment 
      this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to 
      treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not 
      only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent 
      on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.

TI  - Is there a model to teach and practice retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy?
PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.3109/13645706.2012.696544 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although the retroperitoneal approach has been the preferred choice 
      for open urological procedures, retroperitoneoscopy is not the preferred approach 
      for laparoscopy. This study aims to develop a training model for 
      retroperitoneoscopy and to establish an experimental learning curve. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Fifteen piglets were operated on to develop a standard 
      retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy (RPN) training model. All procedures were 
      performed with three ports. Intraoperative data (side, operative time, blood 
      loss, peritoneal opening) were recorded. Animals were divided into groups A, the 
      first eight, and B, the last seven cases. Data were statistically analyzed. 
      RESULTS: We performed fifteen RPNs. The operative time varied from 15 to 50 
      minutes (median 30 minutes). Blood loss varied from 5 to 100 mL (median 20 mL). 
      We experienced five peritoneal openings; we had two surgical vascular 
      complications managed laparoscopically. There was statistical difference between 
      groups A and B for peritoneal opening (p = 0.025), operative time (p = 0.0037), 
      and blood loss (p = 0.026). DISCUSSION: RPN in a porcine model could simulate the 
      whole procedure, from creating the space to nephrectomy completion. Experimental 
      learning curve was eight cases, after statistical data analysis. CONCLUSION: RPN 
      in a porcine model is feasible and could be very useful for teaching and 
      practicing retroperitoneoscopy.

TI  - Is the type of remission after a major depressive episode an important risk 
      factor to relapses in a 4-year follow up?
PG  - 291-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rates of relapse and predictive relapse factors were studied over 
      more than 4 years in a sample of Spanish outpatients with DSM-III-R criteria for 
      unipolar major depressive episode. METHODS: A final sample of 139 outpatient was 
      followed monthly in a naturalistic study. The Structured Clinical Interview for 
      DSM-III-R was used. Phases of evolution were recorded using the Hamilton 
      Depression Rating Scale, applying the Frank criteria. Survival analysis, 
      Kaplan-Meier product limit and proportional hazards models were used. RESULTS: A 
      higher rate of relapses was observed in the partial remission group (91.4%) 
      compared to the complete remission one (51.3%). The four factors with predictive 
      relapse value were: "partial remission versus complete remission", "the intensity 
      of clinical symptoms", "the age" and "the number of previous depressive 
      episodes". The existence of partial remission was the most powerful predictive 
      factor. LIMITATIONS: The decreasing sample size during the follow-up and the 
      difficulty in warranting the treatment compliance. CONCLUSIONS: At medium term, 
      relapse rates for a major depressive episode are high. Partial remission after a 
      depressive episode seems to be an important predictive factor for relapses in a 
      4-year follow-up. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Not reaching complete remission is a strong 
      risk factor for relapses in a 4-year follow up study.

TI  - Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective 
      analgesia reachable in all women? An audit of two years.
PG  - 1262-8
LID - 4100 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social and cultural factors combined with little information may 
      prevent the diffusion of epidural analgesia for pain relief during childbirth. 
      The present study was launched contemporarily to the implementation of analgesia 
      for labor in our Department in order to perform a 2 years audit on its use. The 
      goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital 
      practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance 
      against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all 
      patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and 
      caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side 
      effects. RESULTS: During the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% 
      of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p 
      < 0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A 
      hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual 
      Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 
      8.5+/-1.4 before to 4.1+/-1.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) 
      VAS decreased from 8.12+/-1.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76+/-0.79 after (p < 
      0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after). No other differences between clusters 
      were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Present audit shows that the process of 
      implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding 
      the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural 
      analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to 
      labor analgesia was satisfactory.

TI  - Longer term quality of life and outcome in stroke patients: is the Barthel index 
      alone an adequate measure of outcome?
PG  - 125-30
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To consider whether the Barthel Index alone provides sufficient 
      information about the long term outcome of stroke. DESIGN: Cross sectional follow 
      up study with a structured interview questionnaire and measures of impairment, 
      disability, handicap, and general health. The scales used were the hospital 
      anxiety and depression scale, mini mental state examination, Barthel index, 
      modified Rankin scale, London handicap scale, Frenchay activities index, SF36, 
      Nottingham health profile, life satisfaction index, and the caregiver strain 
      index. SETTING: South east London. SUBJECTS: People, and their identified carers, 
      resident in south east London in 1989-90 when they had their first in a life-time 
      stroke aged under 75 years. INTERVENTIONS: Observational study. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Comparison and correlation of the individual Barthel index scores with 
      the scores on other outcome measures. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty three (42%) 
      people were known to be alive, of whom 106 (86%) were interviewed. The median age 
      was 71 years (range 34-79). The mean interval between the stroke and follow up 
      was 4.9 years. The rank correlation coefficients between the Barthel and the 
      different dimensions of the SF36 ranged from r = 0.217 (with the role emotional 
      dimension) to r = 0.810 (with the physical functioning dimension); with the 
      Nottingham health profile the range was r = -0.189 (with the sleep dimension, NS) 
      to r = -0.840 (with the physical mobility dimension); with the hospital and 
      anxiety scale depression component the coefficient was r = -0.563, with the life 
      satisfaction index r = 0.361, with the London handicap scale r = 0.726 and with 
      the Frenchay activities index r = 0.826. CONCLUSIONS: The place of the Barthel 
      index as the standard outcome measure for populations of stroke patients is still 
      justified for long term follow up, and may be a proxy for different outcome 
      measures intended for the assessment of other domains.

TI  - Does a special interest in laparoscopy affect the treatment of acute 
      cholecystitis?
PG  - 1697-703
AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that the treatment of patients with acute 
      cholecystitis (AC) would be improved under the care of laparoscopic specialists. 
      METHODS: The records of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for AC from 1 January 
      1996 to 31 December 1998 were reviewed retrospectively. Of 170 patients, 48 were 
      cared for by three laparoscopic specialists (LS group), whereas 122 were treated 
      by nine general surgeons who perform only laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) (GS 
      group). The rates of successful LC, complications, and length of hospital stay 
      were compared. Multivariate analysis was used to control for baseline 
      differences. RESULTS: The patients in the GS group were older (median age, 63 vs 
      53 years; p = 0.01). In all, 31 LS patients (65%), as compared with 44 GS 
      patients (36%), had successful laparoscopic treatment (p = 0.001). The operating 
      time was the same (median, 70 min). The proportion of patients with postoperative 
      complications was similar in the two groups (37% in the GS vs 31% in the LS 
      group; p = 0.6). The median postoperative hospital stay (3 vs 5 days; p <0.01) 
      was shorter in the LS group. On logistic regression analysis, significant 
      predictors of a successful laparoscopic operation included LS group (p <0.01) and 
      age (p = 0). Predictors of prolonged length of hospital stay were age (p <0.01) 
      and comorbidity score (p <0.01), with LS group status not a significant factor (p 
      = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AC are more likely to undergo successful LC 
      if cared for by a surgeon with an interest in laparoscopy. However, length of 
      hospital stay is influenced more by patient factors in a multivariate model.

TI  - Do older adults with cancer fall more often? A comparative analysis of falls in 
      those with and without cancer.
PG  - E69-78
LID - 10.1188/13.ONF.E69-E78 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine whether a history of cancer increased the 
      likelihood of a fall in community-dwelling older adults, and if cancer type, 
      stage, or time since diagnosis increased falls. DESIGN: A longitudinal, 
      retrospective, cohort study. SETTING: A home- and community-based waiver program 
      in Michigan. SAMPLE: 862 older adults aged 65 years or older with cancer compared 
      to 8,617 older adults without cancer using data from the Minimum Data Set-Home 
      Care and Michigan cancer registry. METHODS: Reports of falls were examined for 
      90-180 days. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare differences 
      between the groups. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Cancer, falls, patient 
      characteristics, comorbidities, medications, pain, weight loss, vision, memory 
      recall, and activities, as well as cancer type, stage, and time since diagnosis. 
      FINDINGS: A fall occurred at a rate of 33% in older adults with cancer compared 
      to 29% without cancer (p < 0.00). Those with a history of cancer were more likely 
      to fall than those without cancer (adjusted odds ratio 1.16; 95% confidence 
      interval [1.02, 1.33]; p = 0.03). No differences in fall rates were determined by 
      cancer type or stage, and the odds of a fall did not increase when adding time 
      since cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The fall rate was higher in older adults 
      with cancer than in older adults without cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses 
      need to assess fall risk and initiate fall prevention measures for older adults 
      at the time of cancer diagnosis. KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION: When caring for older 
      adults with cancer, nurses should be aware of an increased risk for falls. 
      Healthcare staff also should be aware of an increased risk for falls in that 
      population during cancer treatment. Evidence-based fall prevention measures 
      should be included in care plans for older adult cancer survivors.

TI  - Two-year follow-up survey of patients with allergic contact dermatitis from an 
      occupational cohort: is the prognosis dependent on the omnipresence of the 
      allergen?
PG  - 1100-5
LID - 10.1111/bjd.12795 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin diseases are the most frequently recognized occupational 
      diseases in Denmark. The prognosis for occupational contact dermatitis is often 
      poor. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognosis, assessed by eczema, job status 
      and skin-related quality of life, among patients allergic to rubber chemicals and 
      latex (ubiquitous allergens) and epoxy (nonubiquitous allergen), 2 years after 
      recognition of occupational allergic contact dermatitis. METHODS: From a cohort 
      of all patients recognized as having occupational dermatitis by the Danish 
      National Board of Industrial Injuries in 2010, 199 patients with relevant rubber 
      allergy (contact allergy to rubber chemicals or contact urticaria from latex) or 
      epoxy allergy were identified. Follow-up consisted of a questionnaire covering 
      current severity of eczema, employment, exposure and quality of life. RESULTS: 
      The response rate was 75%. Clearance of eczema was reported by 11% of patients 
      and 67% reported improvement. Overall 22% of patients with allergy to a 
      nonubiquitous allergen had total clearance of eczema compared with 10% of cases 
      allergic to ubiquitous allergens and 0% of those with contact urticaria 
      (P = 0.116). Improvement was significantly more frequent in those who had changed 
      jobs compared with those who had not (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: At follow-up, 
      patients with contact urticaria had significantly poorer prognosis than those 
      with contact allergy, and there was a trend towards a poorer prognosis for those 
      with contact allergy to rubber chemicals than those with allergy to epoxy. A 
      significant positive association between job change and improvement was found.

TI  - Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop 
      oligometastases?
PG  - 3-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze, retrospectively, the patterns and behavior of metastatic 
      lesions in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and 
      to investigate whether patients with < or =5 lesions had an improved outcome 
      relative to patients with >5 lesions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The treatment and 
      outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were 
      analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated 
      with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic 
      disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of 
      involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival. RESULTS: The 
      overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 
      years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 
      90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) 
      who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was 
      significantly reduced (p <0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who 
      developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and 
      patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with 
      vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with < or =5 
      metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with >5 lesions 
      (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p 
      = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval 
      measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the 
      development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with < or 
      =5 lesions compared with patients with >5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, 
      respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of 
      diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups 
      were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with < or =5 metastatic sites had 
      significantly better survival rates than patients with >5 lesions. Because 
      existing sites of metastatic disease may be the primary sites of origin for 
      additional metastases, our findings suggest that early detection and aggressive 
      treatment of patients with a small number of metastatic lesions is worth testing 
      as an approach to improving long-term survival.

TI  - Does radiotherapy around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease modify the 
      risk of breast cancer?
PG  - 1474-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the risk of secondary breast cancer after 
      radiotherapy (RT) for Hodgkin's disease is greater among women who underwent RT 
      around time of pregnancy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 382 women treated 
      with RT for Hodgkin's disease were reviewed and divided into those who received 
      RT around the time of pregnancy and those who were not pregnant. Comparisons of 
      the overall incidence, actuarial rates, and latency to breast cancer between the 
      two groups were made. Multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to 
      determine possible contributing factors. RESULTS: Of the 382 women, 14 developed 
      breast cancer (3.7%). The increase in the overall incidence (16.0% vs. 2.3%, p = 
      0.0001) and the actuarial rate of breast cancer among the women in the pregnant 
      group (p = 0.011) was statistically significant. The women treated around the 
      time of pregnancy had a 10- and 15-year actuarial rate of breast cancer of 6.7% 
      and 32.6%, respectively. The 10-year and 15-year actuarial rate for the 
      nonpregnant women was 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively. The median latency from RT to 
      the diagnosis of breast cancer was 13.1 and 18.9 years for women in the pregnant 
      and nonpregnant groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, pregnancy 
      around the time of RT was the only variable associated with an increased risk of 
      breast cancer. The risk was dependent on the length of time from pregnancy to RT, 
      with women receiving RT during pregnancy and within 1 month of pregnancy having 
      an increased risk of breast cancer compared with nonpregnant women and women 
      irradiated later than 1 month after pregnancy (hazard ratio, 22.49; 95% 
      confidence interval, 5.56-90.88; p <0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study 
      indicate that the risk of breast cancer after RT is greater with irradiation 
      around the time of pregnancy. This suggests that pregnancy is a time of increased 
      sensitivity of breast tissue to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. Because of 
      the small sample size and limited follow-up, additional studies are recommended 
      to confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The alterations of echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) in 
      patients received left atrial appendage LAA occlusion therapy are still unclear. 
      The present study was to evaluate the influence of LAA occlusion device on 
      echocardiography and ECG changes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). 
      METHODS: Seventy-three patients who had undergone Watchman, LAmbre and Lefort 
      were enrolled in this study. Echocardiography and ECG results at pre- and 
      post-operation were collected. Besides, echocardiography was also performed 
      during follow-up visits at 1, 6 and 12months after discharge. RESULTS: After LAA 
      occlusion, a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis was observed in 
      most patients. The significant differences were also observed in heart rate (HR) 
      and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. 
      There existed no significant difference in echocardiographic parameters between 
      before and after device implantation. However, a larger left atrial (LA) diameter 
      was detected by echocardiography during follow-up visit at 6months when compared 
      with pre-operation parameters. Similarly, aortic root diameter (ARD) was also 
      larger during follow-up at 12months than the baseline dimension in pre-operation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, 
      reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA 
      diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.

TI  - Is non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated 
      hepatic cirrhosis possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography?
PG  - 60-6
LID - 10.1007/s12664-016-0630-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Esophageal varices are present in 30% to 40% of patients in 
      compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) and in 60% to 85% of patients in 
      decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes B and C). It is important to identify 
      patients with compensated cirrhosis at risk for esophageal varix development. We 
      evaluated the accuracy of a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index for predicting 
      the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated 
      hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) by using endoscopy as the reference 
      standard. METHODS: Fifty-six enrolled patients underwent duplex Doppler 
      ultrasonography followed by screening endoscopy. Mean portal vein velocity (PVV), 
      splenic index (SI), splenoportal index (SPI), hepatic and splenic arterial 
      resistive, and pulsatility indices (hepatic artery resistive index [HARI], 
      hepatic artery pulsatility index [HAPI], splenic artery resistive index [SARI], 
      splenic artery pulsatility index [SAPI]) were recorded. Univariate logistic 
      regression analysis was followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
      construction for the indices that were significant. RESULTS: The indices HARI, 
      HAPI, SARI, SAPI were not helpful (p > 0.05). Mean PVV, SI, and SPI were all 
      predictive of the presence of esophageal varices (p < 0.05) and SPI was found to 
      be the most accurate parameter. Of the various cut-off levels of SPI evaluated, a 
      cut-off value of SPI at 5.0, offered the highest diagnostic accuracy (88%). For 
      the 28 patients with SPI <5.0, the absence of esophageal varices in 27 of them 
      could be correctly diagnosed using only SPI without invasive screening endoscopy, 
      with high negative predictive value (96%) and sensitivity (96%). Of the remaining 
      28 patients with SPI >/=5.0, presence of esophageal varices could be similarly 
      correctly diagnosed in 22 of them by using SPI without screening endoscopy, with 
      high positive predictive value (79%) and specificity (82%). CONCLUSION: The SPI 
      was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in 
      patients with compensated cirrhosis.

TI  - Do inhaled steroids differ from cromones in terms of hospital admission rates for 
      asthma in children?
PG  - 1612-8
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of 
      hospital admissions in two child populations receiving different types of drugs 
      as their regular medication for steady-state asthma. METHODS: Annual data on 
      children aged under 16 y treated for asthma, including consumption of regular 
      medication for asthma, numbers of hospital periods, lengths of hospitalizations 
      and annual proportions of readmissions, were collected using patient-specific 
      medical records from 1995 to 1999. In the Kuopio province, on average, 
      35.6-36.7/1000 children were on maintenance for asthma, of which 23% were 
      receiving cromones, 51% were taking inhaled steroids and 26% were treated with 
      cromones plus intermittent steroids. In the Oulu province, the respective 
      prevalence was 32.7-34.9/1000, and the respective proportions were 5%, 93% and 
      2%. RESULTS: Total and first admissions, as well as hospital days were clearly 
      less in the Oulu province. In the children aged > or = 6y, the average annual 
      total admissions were 0.3/1000 (Oulu) vs 1.2/1000 (Kuopio) (p < 0.001). 
      Similarly, the first admissions were 0.2/1000 vs 1.0/1000 (p < 0.001), 
      proportions of readmissions 6.3% vs 19.3% (p < 0.05), and numbers of hospital 
      days 0.7/1000 vs 3.8/1000 (p < 0.001). The differences were in the same 
      direction, though less prominent, also among children 2-5 y of age. CONCLUSION: 
      Our results suggest that inhaled steroids are better than cromones in preventing 
      admissions for asthma when two provinces with different practices for maintenance 
      medication of steady-state asthma were compared.

TI  - Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients? 
      A retrospective case review.
PG  - 2651-7
LID - 10.12659/MSM.892230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is tightly linked to increased 
      cardiovascular disease. Surgery is an important method to treat OSA, but its 
      effect on serum lipid levels in OSA patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the 
      effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective review of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent 
      surgery (nasal or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP]) at a major, urban, academic 
      hospital in Beijing from 2012 to 2013 who had preoperative and postoperative 
      serum lipid profiles. RESULTS: Serum TC (4.86+/-0.74 to 4.69+/-0.71) and LP(a) 
      (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 
      0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For 
      UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, 
      respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased 
      (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) 
      decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, 
      the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03, <0.01, 
      respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) 
      decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06). In 
      patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, the serum TC and LDL also decreased (P=0.02, 
      0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery may improve blood lipid levels in 
      patients with OSA, especially in patients with preoperative dyslipidemia, 
      potentially yielding a major benefit in metabolism and cardiovascular sequelae. 
      Prospective studies should examine this potential metabolic effect of airway 
      surgery for OSA.

TI  - Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: 
      can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted?
PG  - 727-31
LID - 10.1016/j.injury.2008.11.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations 
      has significantly increased across the globe over the past decade. These 
      incidents often result in Hospital Multiple Casualty Incidents (HMCI), which are 
      very challenging to hospital teams. 15 years ago the Emergency and Disaster 
      Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health defined a key of 20 percent 
      of each hospital's bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties. Half of 
      those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study 
      was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based 
      on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. METHODS: A retrospective study of HMCIs 
      was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the 
      Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An 
      HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli 
      Ministry of Health as >or=10 casualties or >or=4 suffering from injuries with an 
      ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. RESULTS: The study includes a total of 
      32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of 
      arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 
      16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52. Based on severity scores 
      and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed 
      number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of 
      the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation 
      of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health 
      resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.

PG  - 2273-81

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether problems in instrumental activities of daily 
      living (IADL) can add to conventionally used clinical measurements in helping to 
      predict a diagnosis of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up. DESIGN: Multicenter 
      prospective cohort study. SETTING: Memory clinics in Europe. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Individuals aged 55 and older without dementia. MEASUREMENTS: IADLs were measured 
      using pooled activities from five informant-based questionnaires. Structural 
      equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and 
      dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental 
      State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model. RESULTS: Five 
      hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 
      (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 
      481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. 
      Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate 
      (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square = 4.28, 
      degrees of freedom = 1, P = .04). SEM showed that IADL disability could help 
      predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds 
      ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up 
      (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.33-3.33). CONCLUSION: IADL disability is a useful addition 
      to the diagnostic process in a memory clinic setting, indicating who is at higher 
      risk of developing dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.

TI  - Is pelvic pain associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ 
      prolapse?
PG  - 1305-8
LID - 10.1002/nau.21059 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of pelvic pain and its association 
      with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). STUDY DESIGN: 
      This is a cross sectional study of 248 women with stage II POP or greater. Women 
      were stratified into "pain" and "no-pain" groups based on their response to a 
      question on the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory short form. Associations between 
      patient demographics, exam findings and responses to validated questionnaires 
      were evaluated. RESULTS: In women with POP, defecatory symptoms are significantly 
      more common in women with pelvic pain including straining with bowel movement (OR 
      2.4, 95% CI 1.3, 4.6), sense of incomplete emptying (OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.3, 8.2), 
      pain with bowel movement (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.2, 23.0) and splinting with bowel 
      movement (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.0, 7.5). CONCLUSION: In women with POP, the symptom of 
      pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.

TI  - Does the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension identify cognitive impairments?
PG  - 94-101
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relevance of the Symptom Checklist 90-R 
      Obsessive-Compulsive subscale to cognition in individuals with brain tumor. 
      DESIGN: A prospective study of patients assessed with a neuropsychological test 
      battery. SETTING: A university medical center. PATIENTS: Nineteen adults with 
      biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of malignant brain tumors were assessed prior to 
      aggressive chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Included in the assessment were 
      the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making 
      Test B, Symptom Checklist 90-R, Mood Assessment Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, 
      and Chronic Illness Problem Inventory. RESULTS: The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive 
      subscale was not related to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or 
      age. It was related significantly to symptoms of depression (r = .81, P < .005), 
      anxiety (r = .66, P < .005), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = 
      .75, P < .005). Multivariate analyses indicated that reported symptoms of 
      depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R 
      Obsessive-Compulsive Scores, whereas symptoms of anxiety contributed an 
      additional 6% (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is 
      best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic 
      effects of structural brain injury.

TI  - Is non-HDL-cholesterol a better predictor of long-term outcome in patients after 
      acute myocardial infarction compared to LDL-cholesterol? : a retrospective study.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s12872-016-0450-9 [doi]
LID - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been shown that non-high density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (non-HDL-C) may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than low 
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Based on known ethic differences in 
      lipid parameters and cardiovascular risk prediction, we sought to study the 
      predictability of attaining non-HDL-C target and long-term major adverse 
      cardiovascular event (MACE) in Thai patients after acute myocardial infarction 
      (AMI) compared to attaining LDL-C target. METHODS: We retrospectively obtained 
      the data of all patients who were admitted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital 
      due to AMI during 2006-2013. The mean non-HDL-C and LDL-C during long-term 
      follow-up were used to predict MACE at each time point. The patients were 
      classified as target attainment if non-HDL-C <100 mg/dl and/or LDL-C <70 mg/dl. 
      The MACE was defined as combination of all-cause death, nonfatal coronary event 
      and nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 2.6 +/- 1.6 years among 868 
      patients after AMI, 34.4% achieved non-HDL-C target, 23.7% achieved LDL-C target 
      and 21.2% experienced MACEs. LDL-C and non-HDL-C were directly compared in Cox 
      regression model. Compared with non-HDL-C <100 mg/dl, patients with non-HDL-C of 
      >130 mg/dl had higher incidence of MACEs (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.46-6.80, P = 0.003). 
      Surprisingly, LDL-C >100 mg/dl was associated with reduced risk of MACE as 
      compared to LDL <70 mg/dl (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.98, p = 0.046) after direct 
      pairwise comparison with non-HDL-C level. CONCLUSIONS: Non-attaining non-HDL-C 
      goal predicted MACE at long-term follow-up after AMI whereas non-attaining LDL-C 
      goal was not associated with the higher risk. Therefore, non-HDL-C may be a more 
      suitable target of dyslipidemia treatment than LDL-C in patients after AMI.

TI  - Body diffusion-weighted MR imaging of uterine endometrial cancer: is it helpful 
      in the detection of cancer in nonenhanced MR imaging?
PG  - 122-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ejrad.2007.11.042 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors discussed the feasibility and value of 
      diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer 
      in addition to conventional nonenhanced MR images. METHODS AND MATERIALS: DW 
      images of endometrial cancer in 23 patients were examined by using a 1.5-T MR 
      scanner. This study investigated whether or not DW images offer additional 
      incremental value to conventional nonenhanced MR imaging in comparison with 
      histopathological results. Moreover, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
      values were measured in the regions of interest within the endometrial cancer and 
      compared with those of normal endometrium and myometrium in 31 volunteers, 
      leiomyoma in 14 patients and adenomyosis in 10 patients. The Wilcoxon rank sum 
      test was used, with a p<0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In 19 
      of 23 patients, endometrial cancers were detected only on T2-weighted images. In 
      the remaining 4 patients, of whom two had coexisting leiomyoma, no cancer was 
      detected on T2-weighted images. This corresponds to an 83% detection sensitivity 
      for the carcinomas. When DW images and fused DW images/T2-weighted images were 
      used in addition to the T2-weighted images, cancers were identified in 3 of the 
      remaining 4 patients in addition to the 19 patients (overall detection 
      sensitivity of 96%). The mean ADC value of endometrial cancer (n=22) was 
      (0.97+/-0.19)x10(-3)mm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than those of the 
      normal endometrium, myometrium, leiomyoma and adenomyosis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      DW imaging can be helpful in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer in 
      nonenhanced MR imaging.

TI  - Does pediatric housestaff experience influence tests ordered for infants in the 
      neonatal intensive care unit?
PG  - 704-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between the experience of pediatric 
      housestaff and tests ordered on infants in the neonatal intensive care unit 
      (ICU). DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study over one full academic year. SETTING: 
      One academic Level III neonatal intensive care nursery. PATIENTS: Data were 
      collected prospectively on all 785 infants admitted to the neonatal ICU from July 
      1993 to June 1994. These infants were cared for by 14 different categorical 
      pediatric housestaff. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our neonatal ICU has either 
      a resident or an intern on-call by himself/herself at night, affording us a 
      natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of 
      interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes 
      ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the 
      morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness 
      of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring 
      System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of 
      admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). 
      Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call 
      night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns 
      ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per 
      infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call 
      night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night). This increase of 
      0.33 blood gases per infant amounts to interns ordering $169 more arterial blood 
      gases per call night at our institution. There was no difference between interns 
      and residents in ordering radiographs or electrolytes. CONCLUSION: Interns order 
      significantly more arterial blood gases per infant than junior and senior 
      residents on-call in the neonatal ICU. Additional study is required to see if the 
      experience of housestaff is associated with a broader array of neonatal outcomes, 
      such as morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for 
      aerobiological monitoring?
PG  - 508-14
LID - 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60268-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and updated information on airborne pollen in specific areas 
      can help allergic patients. Current monitoring systems are based on a morphologic 
      identification approach, a time-consuming method that may represent a limiting 
      factor for sampling network enhancement. OBJECTIVE: To verify the feasibility of 
      developing a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, an alternative 
      to optical analysis, as a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for the detection 
      and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa. METHODS: The traditional 
      cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from 
      pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or 
      literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; 
      based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes 
      were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested 
      on 3 plant species. RESULTS: The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol 
      allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene 
      fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes 
      identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. 
      Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological 
      tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully 
      performed on test species and in mixes. CONCLUSIONS: The real-time PCR approach 
      revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when 
      analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of 
      multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the 
      same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.

TI  - Is the 7th TNM edition suitable for biological predictor in early gastric cancer?
PG  - 1225-30
LID - 10.5754/hge11579 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The clinical and prognostic value of the previous node 
      classification of TNM staging in early gastric cancer (EGC) has been less 
      definitive. The aim was to assess the suitability of the revised node staging for 
      prediction of clinical behavior of EGC. METHODOLOGY: Between 2005 and 2008, 1,845 
      patients were diagnosed with EGC and underwent surgery at Severance Hospitals. 
      Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed with comparisons between sixth 
      and seventh TNM staging. RESULTS: When comparing IB with IIA upstaged based on 
      seventh staging, poor differentiation, signet ring cell, diffuse, 
      undifferentiated types, perineural invasion (PNI), larger size and younger age, 
      were more significantly associated with IIA. Clinicopathological factors were 
      compared between N0/N1 and N2/N3 based on both staging. In mucosal cancer, 
      younger age, diffuse and undifferentiated types were more significantly 
      associated with N2/N3 based on seventh staging. In submucosal cancer, larger 
      size, poor differentiation, signet ring cell, diffuse, undifferentiated types, 
      PNI and deeper submucosal invasion, were more significantly associated with N2/N3 
      based on seventh staging. CONCLUSIONS: Upstaging in EGC based on the revised TNM 
      staging reflects more aggressive biological behavior of cancer. The new TNM 
      staging system may be informative in prediction of biological behavior of EGC as 
      well as prognosis and survival.

TI  - Are lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 
      associated with improved outcomes?: U.K. prospective diabetes study 61.
PG  - 1410-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes may be present for several years before diagnosis, by 
      which time many patients have already developed diabetic complications. Earlier 
      detection and treatment may reduce this burden, but evidence to support this 
      approach is lacking. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Glycemic control and clinical 
      and surrogate outcomes were compared for 5,088 of 5,102 U.K. Diabetes Prospective 
      Study participants according to whether they had low (<140 mg/dl [<7.8 mmol/l]), 
      intermediate (140 to <180 mg/dl [7.8 to <10.0 mmol/l]), or high (> or =180 mg/dl 
      [> or =10 mmol/l]) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at diagnosis. Individuals 
      who presented with and without diabetic symptoms were also compared. RESULTS: 
      Fewer people with FPG in the lowest category had retinopathy, abnormal 
      biothesiometer measurements, or reported erectile dysfunction. The rate of 
      increase in FPG and HbA(1c) during the study was identical in all three groups, 
      although absolute differences persisted. Individuals in the low FPG group had a 
      significantly reduced risk for each predefined clinical outcome except stroke, 
      whereas those in the intermediate group had significantly reduced risk for each 
      outcome except stroke and myocardial infarction. The low and intermediate FPG 
      groups had a significantly reduced risk for progression of retinopathy, reduction 
      in vibration sensory threshold, or development of microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: 
      People presenting with type 2 diabetes with lower initial glycemia who may be 
      earlier in the course of their disease had fewer adverse clinical outcomes 
      despite similar glycemic progression. Since most such people are asymptomatic at 
      diagnosis, active case detection programs would be required to identify them.

TI  - Remote ischemic postconditioning: does it protect against ischemic damage in 
      percutaneous coronary revascularization? justification and design of a randomized 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 164-9
LID - 10.1159/000331432 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Myocardial damage that is associated with percutaneous coronary 
      intervention (PCI) partially affects the results of the procedure, and is related 
      to medium-term cardiovascular death. Remote postischemic conditioning might 
      reduce the myocardial lesions that are associated with PCI, but perhaps less so 
      in diabetics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of 
      remote postischemic conditioning in patients undergoing elective PCI for stable 
      angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome with troponin <1 ng/ml at the 
      time of randomization. METHODS: This randomized single-blinded single-center 
      clinical trial involved 320 patients undergoing elective PCI who were randomized 
      to either receive three 5-min cycles of ischemia by inflation of a cuff on the 
      non-dominant arm to 200 mm Hg (remote postischemic conditioning) or to placebo 
      (uninflated cuff). The primary outcome variable was the maximum increase in 
      troponin in the first 24 h. The secondary outcome variable was readmission due to 
      heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up. In addition, 
      a diabetic population was studied. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial evaluated the 
      possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was 
      attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.

LID - S1356-689X(16)30700-7 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing 
      loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of 
      the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies 
      suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in 
      patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on 
      tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. 
      PATIENTS: Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus 
      Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth 
      Questionnaire (NBQ) > 14 points). INTERVENTION: All patients received cervical 
      physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an 
      immediate-start therapy group (n = 19) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group 
      (n = 19). MEASUREMENTS: TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the 
      wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks 
      follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring 
      moments, except at baseline. RESULTS: In all patients (n = 38) TFI and NBQ-scores 
      decreased significantly after treatment (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001). NBQ-scores 
      remained significantly lower after follow-up (p = 0.001). Immediately after 
      treatment, 53% (n = 38) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This 
      effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. 
      CONCLUSION: Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective 
      tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck 
      complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however 
      necessary to prove this effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02016313.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant 
      information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' 
      perceptions of an antenatal intervention. METHODS: Pregnant women (n=35) and 
      trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the 
      title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental 
      conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; 
      Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their 
      perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, 
      Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales. RESULTS: A 4x2 factorial 
      multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double 
      Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) 
      and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions. CONCLUSION: Font influenced 
      pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: 
      Results have implications for ethical recruitment, and in turn, the optimisation 
      of corresponding interventions.

      improving the programme. METHODS: A survey of set 2005 TOD on ODT was carried out 
      in Ghana, 2006. RESULTS: The trainees included 10 (83.35%) males and two (16.7%) 
      females whose ages ranged between thirty-two and fifty-one years. The sponsors of 
      the trainees included Sight Savers International, five (41.7%); Christian Blind 
      Mission International, three (25.0%); Eye Foundation, Lagos, Nigeria two (16.7%); 
      Ministry of Defence Nigeria, one (8.3%); and Health Authority Ghana, one (8.3%). 
      Nine trainees (75.0%) felt the programme was well structured, training allowances 
      were adequate eight (66.7%) and inadequate four (33.3%). Eleven (91.7%) trainees 
      would work wherever they were posted; ten (83.3%) trainees had sense of 
      fulfillment and three (25%) would like to proceed for residency training. All 
      trainees were at least good in chalazion surgery and treatment of common medical 
      eye conditions. Majority were at least good in eye surgery like cataract, eleven 
      (91.7%); trabeculectomy nine (75.0%); pterygium 10 (83.3%); eyelid, eight 
      (66.7%); destructive 11 (91.6%) and refraction 9 (75.0%). Some trainees' 
      perceived problems included inadequate sponsorship (33.3%), short duration of the 
      course four (33.3%) and poor accommodation facility two (16.7%). However, 
      trainees' suggested increase in training posts, four (33.3); training allowance 
      three (25.0%); and incentives for trainers/training hospitals two (16.7%). 
      CONCLUSION: The ODT programme ensures ophthalmic manpower for secondary eye care 
      level despite challenges. The stakeholders should look into problems facing the 
      programme in order to improve it.

TI  - Predicting admission at triage: are nurses better than a simple objective score?
PG  - 2-7
LID - 10.1136/emermed-2014-204455 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We compared two methods of predicting hospital admission from ED triage: 
      probabilities estimated by triage nurses and probabilities calculated by the 
      Glasgow Admission Prediction Score (GAPS). METHODS: In this single-centre 
      prospective study, triage nurses estimated the probability of admission using a 
      100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and GAPS was generated automatically from 
      triage data. We compared calibration using rank sum tests, discrimination using 
      area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and accuracy with 
      McNemar's test. RESULTS: Of 1829 attendances, 745 (40.7%) were admitted, not 
      significantly different from GAPS' prediction of 750 (41.0%, p=0.678). In 
      contrast, the nurses' mean VAS predicted 865 admissions (47.3%), overestimating 
      by 6.6% (p<0.0001). GAPS discriminated between admission and discharge as well as 
      nurses, its AUC 0.876 compared with 0.875 for VAS (p=0.93). As a binary 
      predictor, its accuracy was 80.6%, again comparable with VAS (79.0%), p=0.18. In 
      the minority of attendances, when nurses felt at least 95% certain of the 
      outcome, VAS' accuracy was excellent, at 92.4%. However, in the remaining 
      majority, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration (+1.2% vs +9.2%, 
      p<0.0001), discrimination (AUC 0.810 vs 0.759, p=0.001) and accuracy (75.1% vs 
      68.9%, p=0.0009). When we used GAPS, but 'over-ruled' it when clinical certainty 
      was >/=95%, this significantly outperformed either method, with AUC 0.891 
      (0.877-0.907) and accuracy 82.5% (80.7%-84.2%). CONCLUSIONS: GAPS, a simple 
      clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the 
      nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be 
      respected.

TI  - Are adult body circumferences associated with height? Relevance to normative 
      ranges and circumferential indexes.
PG  - 302-7
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.110.005132 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight scales as height squared, which is an observation that forms 
      the basis of body mass index (weight/height(2)). If, and how, circumferences, 
      including waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC), scale to height 
      remains unclear, but this is an important consideration when developing normative 
      ranges or applying WC/height and HC/height as risk indexes. OBJECTIVE: The study 
      aim was to examine the scaling of weight, WC, and HC to height in NHANES 
      (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) III participants. DESIGN: 
      Subjects were adult non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American 
      men (n = 7422) and nonpregnant women (n = 7999) who had complete demographic and 
      anthropometric data. In addition to height, allometric models were developed for 
      each measure that controlled for age, race, and self-reported health status. 
      RESULTS: After adjustment for age and race, weight scaled to height in men and 
      women with mean (+/-SEE) powers of 2.29 +/- 0.11 and 1.80 +/- 0.07, respectively (both 
      P < 0.001). Although univariate circumference-height models were weak or 
      nonsignificant, when adjusted for age and race WC and HC scaled to height with 
      powers of 0.76 +/- 0.08 and 0.45 +/- 0.05, respectively, in men and 0.80 +/- 0.05 and 
      0.53 +/- 0.04, respectively, in women (all P < 0.001). Age- and race-adjusted 
      incremental increases in circumferences ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 cm per centimeter 
      increase in height. Both WC/height and HC/height scaled negatively to height in 
      men and women, and WC/HC scaled negatively to height in women only (all P < 
      0.001). Health status-adjusted models were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Circumferences 
      and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for 
      age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These 
      observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these 
      anthropometric measures and indexes.

TI  - Can progression of valvar aortic stenosis be predicted accurately?
PG  - 676-80; discussion 680
AB  - BACKGROUND: It was the aim of the present study to elaborate criteria for the 
      assessment of rapid hemodynamic progression of valvar aortic stenosis. These 
      criteria are of special importance when cardiac surgery is indicated for other 
      reasons but the established criteria for aortic valve replacement are not yet 
      fulfilled. Such aspects of therapeutic planing were mostly disregarded in the 
      past so that patients had to undergo cardiac reoperation within a few years. 
      METHODS: Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and clinical data of 169 men and 88 
      women with aortic stenosis, aged 55.2 +/- 15.7 years at their first and 63.4 +/- 
      15.6 years at their second cardiac catheterization, were analyzed. RESULTS: The 
      progression rate of aortic valve obstruction was found to be dependent on the 
      degree of valvar calcification ([VC] scoring 0 to III) and to be exponentially 
      correlated with the aortic valve opening area (AVA) at initial catheterization. 
      Neither age nor sex of the patient nor etiology of the valvar obstruction 
      significantly influence the progression of aortic stenosis. If AVA decreases 
      below 0.75 cm(2) with a present degree of VC = 0, or AVA of 0.8 with VC of I, AVA 
      of 0.9 with VC of II, or AVA of 1.0 with VC of III, it is probable that aortic 
      stenosis will have to be operated upon in the following years. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present data indicate that for clinical purposes and planning of valvar surgery 
      the progression of asymptomatic aortic stenosis can be sufficiently predicted by 
      the present aortic valve opening area and the degree of valvar calcification.

TI  - Does the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale favor left hemisphere 
      strokes? NINDS t-PA Stroke Study Group.
PG  - 2355-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is 
      a valid, reproducible scale that measures neurological deficit. Of 42 possible 
      points, 7 points are directly related to measurement of language compared with 
      only 2 points related to neglect. METHODS: We examined the placebo arm of the 
      NINDS t-PA stroke trial to test the hypothesis that the total volume of cerebral 
      infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes would be greater than the 
      volume of cerebral infarction in patients with left hemisphere strokes who have 
      similar NIHSS scores. The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image 
      analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. 
      Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed 
      lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of 
      stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to 
      determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume. RESULTS: The 
      volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for 
      left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 
      5-point category of the NIHSS score <20, the median volume of right hemisphere 
      strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. 
      For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score 
      of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile 
      range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) 
      for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001). The median volume of a 
      right hemisphere stroke was roughly equal to the median volume of a left 
      hemisphere stroke in the next highest 5-point category of the NIHSS. The Spearman 
      rank correlation between the 24-hour NIHSS score and 3-month lesion volume was 
      0.72 for patients with left hemisphere stroke and 0.71 for patients with right 
      hemisphere stroke. CONCLUSIONS: For a given NIHSS score, the median volume of 
      right hemisphere strokes is consistently larger than the median volume of left 
      hemisphere strokes. The clinical implications of our finding need further 
      exploration.

TI  - MiraLAX vs. Golytely: is there a significant difference in the adenoma detection 
      rate?
PG  - 775-82
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04795.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent clinical trials (RCT) of bowel preparation, Golytely was 
      more efficacious than MiraLAX. We hypothesised that there is a difference in 
      adenoma detection between Golytely and MiraLAX. AIMS: To compare the adenoma 
      detection rate (ADR) between these bowel preparations, and to identify 
      independent predictors of bowel preparation quality and adenoma detection. 
      METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of an RCT that assessed efficacy and 
      patient tolerability of Golytely vs. MiraLAX/Gatorade in average risk screening 
      colonoscopy patients. Bowel preparation quality was measured with the Boston 
      Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). An excellent/good equivalent BBPS score was 
      defined as >/= 7. Polyp pathology review was performed. ADR was defined as the 
      proportion of colonoscopies with an adenoma. Univariate and multivariate analyses 
      were conducted. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients were prospectively 
      enrolled (87 MiraLAX, 103 Golytely). Golytely had a higher rate of a BBPS score >/= 
      7 (82.5% vs. MiraLAX 67.8%, P=0.02). The ADR in the Golytely cohort was 26.2% 
      (27/103), and was 16.1% (14/87) for MiraLAX (P = 0.091). On multivariate 
      analyses, Golytely was 2.13 x more likely to be associated with a BBPS >/= 7 (95% 
      CI 1.05-4.32, P = 0.04) and 2.28 x more likely to be associated with adenoma 
      detection (95% CI 1.05-4.98, P = 0.04) than MiraLAX. CONCLUSIONS: Golytely was 
      more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently 
      associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS >/= 7) and higher adenoma detection. 
      Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies 
      with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.

TI  - Can gingival crevicular blood be relied upon for assessment of blood glucose 
      level?
PG  - 38-42
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is undiagnosed in approximately half of the patients 
      actually suffering from the disease. In addition, the prevalence of DM is more 
      than twice as high as in patients with periodontitis when compared to 
      periodontally healthy subjects. Thus, a high number of patients with 
      periodontitis may have undiagnosed DM. The purpose of the present study was to 
      evaluate whether blood oozing from a gingival crevice during routine periodontal 
      examination can be used for determining glucose levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Observational cross-sectional studies were carried out in 75 patients (43 males 
      and 32 females) with chronic periodontitis who were divided into two groups: 
      Group I and Group II, respectively. Blood oozing from the gingival crevices of 
      anterior teeth following periodontal probing was collected with the stick of 
      glucose self-monitoring device, and the blood glucose levels were measured. At 
      the same time, finger-prick blood was taken for glucometric analysis and 
      subsequent readings were recorded. RESULTS: The patient's blood glucose values 
      ranged from 74 to 256 mg/dl. The comparison between gingival crevicular blood and 
      finger-prick blood showed a very strong correlation, with a t value of 3.97 (at P 
      value = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study has shown that GCB 
      collected during diagnostic periodontal examination can be an excellent source of 
      blood for glucometric analysis.

TI  - Is zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate sustainable? A 5-year 
      perspective.
PG  - e1485-93
LID - 10.1542/peds.2014-2523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adoption and implementation of evidence-based measures 
      for catheter care leads to reductions in central line-associated bloodstream 
      infection (CLABSI) rates in the NICU. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
      whether this rate reduction is sustainable for at least 1 year and to identify 
      key determinants of this sustainability at the NICU of the Floating Hospital for 
      Children at Tufts Medical Center. METHODS: We reviewed the incidence of CLABSIs 
      in the NICU temporally to the implementation of new practice policies and 
      procedures, from July 2008 to December 2013. RESULTS: Adoption of standardized 
      care practices, including bundles and checklists, was associated with a 
      significant reduction of the CLABSI rate to zero for >370 consecutive days in our 
      NICU in 2012. Overall, our CLABSI rates decreased from 4.1 per 1000 line days in 
      2009 (13 infections; 3163 line days) to 0.94 in 2013 (2 infections; 2115 line 
      days), which represents a 77% reduction over a 5-year period. In the first 
      quarter of 2013, there was a brief increase in CLABSI rate to 3.3 per 1000 line 
      days; after a series of interventions, the CLABSI rate was maintained at zero for 
      >600 days. Ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion 
      and maintenance practices and improved documentation were identified as key 
      drivers for success. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality training, strict compliance with 
      evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with 
      significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better 
      understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and 
      sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.

TI  - Does treatment duration affect outcome after radiotherapy for prostate cancer?
PG  - 1402-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.03.011 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The protraction of external beam radiotherapy (RT) time is detrimental 
      in several disease sites. In prostate cancer, the overall treatment time can be 
      considerable, as can the potential for treatment breaks. We evaluated the effect 
      of elapsed treatment time on outcome after RT for prostate cancer. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Between April 1989 and November 2004, 1,796 men with prostate cancer 
      were treated with RT alone. The nontreatment day ratio (NTDR) was defined as the 
      number of nontreatment days divided by the total elapsed days of RT. This ratio 
      was used to account for the relationship between treatment duration and total RT 
      dose. Men were stratified into low risk (n = 789), intermediate risk (n = 798), 
      and high risk (n = 209) using a single-factor model. RESULTS: The 10-year freedom 
      from biochemical failure (FFBF) rate was 68% for a NTDR <33% vs. 58% for NTDR 
      >/=33% (p = 0.02; BF was defined as a prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL). 
      In the low-risk group, the 10-year FFBF rate was 82% for NTDR <33% vs. 57% for 
      NTDR >/=33% (p = 0.0019). The NTDR was independently predictive for FFBF (p = 
      0.03), in addition to T stage (p = 0.005) and initial prostate-specific antigen 
      level (p < 0.0001) on multivariate analysis, including Gleason score and 
      radiation dose. The NTDR was not a significant predictor of FFBF when examined in 
      the intermediate-risk group, high-risk group, or all risk groups combined. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an 
      adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of 
      >/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should 
      be avoided.

TI  - Patient-Controlled Therapy of Breathlessness in Palliative Care: A New 
      Therapeutic Concept for Opioid Administration?
PG  - 581-8
LID - S0885-3924(15)00579-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2015.10.015 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Breathlessness is one of the most distressing symptoms experienced by 
      patients with advanced cancer and noncancer diagnoses alike. Often, severity of 
      breathlessness increases quickly, calling for rapid symptom control. Oral, 
      buccal, and parenteral routes of provider-controlled drug administration have 
      been described. It is unclear whether patient-controlled therapy (PCT) systems 
      would be an additional treatment option. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether 
      intravenous opioid PCT can be an effective therapeutic method to reduce 
      breathlessness in patients with advanced disease. Secondary aims were to study 
      the feasibility and acceptance of opioid PCT in patients with refractory 
      breathlessness. METHODS: This was a pilot observational study with 18 inpatients 
      with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness receiving opioid PCT. 
      Breathlessness was measured on a self-reported numeric rating scale. Richmond 
      Agitation Sedation Scale scores, Palliative Performance Scale scores, vital 
      signs, and a self-developed patient satisfaction questionnaire were used for 
      measuring secondary outcomes. Descriptive and interference analyses (Friedman 
      test) and post hoc analyses (Wilcoxon tests and Bonferroni corrections) were 
      performed. RESULTS: Eighteen of 815 patients (advanced cancer; median 
      age = 57.5 years [range 36-81]; 77.8% female) received breathlessness symptom 
      control with opioid PCT; daily morphine equivalent dose at Day 1 was 
      median = 20.3 mg (5.0-49.6 mg); Day 2: 13.0 mg (1.0-78.5 mg); Day 3: 16.0 mg 
      (8.3-47.0 mg). Numeric rating scale of current breathlessness decreased 
      (baseline: median = 5 [range 1-10]; Day 1: median = 4 [range 0-8], P < 0.01; Day 
      2: median = 4 [range 0-5], P < 0.01). Physiological parameters were stable over 
      time. On Day 3, 12/12 patients confirmed that this mode of application provided 
      relief of breathlessness. CONCLUSION: Opioid PCT is a feasible and acceptable 
      therapeutic method to reduce refractory breathlessness in palliative care 
      patients.

TI  - [Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry? A clinical 
      epidemiological cross-sectional study in patients with psychiatric disorders].
PG  - 28-37
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in 
      psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital. METHODS: Using a questionnaire we 
      investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, 
      impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed 
      with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential 
      risk factors were explored. RESULTS: The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, 
      the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' 
      most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. 
      Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed 
      by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with 
      psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. 
      Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past 
      year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric 
      diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression 
      (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609). 
      CONCLUSION: We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in 
      psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The 
      investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific 
      risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.

LID - 10.1007/s00590-012-1063-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare clinical effectiveness of operative 
      with nonoperative treatment for displaced midshaft clavicular fractures (DMCF). 
      METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases (MEDILINE, EMBASE, 
      CLINICAL, OVID, BIOSIS and Cochrane registry of controlled clinical trials) to 
      identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which operative treatment was 
      compared with nonoperative treatment for DMCF from 1980 to 2012. The methodologic 
      quality of trials was assessed. Data from chosen studies were pooled with using 
      of fixed-effects and random-effects models with mean differences and risk ratios 
      for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Four RCTs with a 
      total of 321 patients were screened for the present study. Results showed that 
      the operative treatment was superior to the nonoperative treatment regarding the 
      rate of nonunion [95 % confidence interval (CI) (0.05, 0.43), P = 0.0004], 
      malunion [95 % CI (0.06, 0.34), P < 0.00001] and overall complication [95 % CI 
      (0.43-0.76), P = 0.0001]. Subgroup analyses of complications revealed that 
      significant differences were existed in the incidence of neurologic symptoms 
      [95 % CI (0.20, 0.74), P = 0.004] and dissatisfaction with appearance [95 % CI 
      (0.19, 0.65), P = 0.001]. Lack of consistent and standardized assessment data, 
      insufficiency analysis that carried out showed improved functional outcomes 
      (P < 0.05) in operative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests 
      that the operative treatment for DMCF is associated with a lower rate of 
      nonunion, malunion and complication than nonoperative treatment. This study 
      supports traditional primary operative treatment for DMCF in active adults.

AB  - AIM: In the TELEDIAB-1 study, the Diabeo system (a smartphone coupled to a 
      website) improved HbA1c by 0.9% vs controls in patients with chronic, poorly 
      controlled type 1 diabetes. The system provided two main functions: automated 
      advice on the insulin doses required; and remote monitoring by teleconsultation. 
      The question is: how much did each function contribute to the improvement in 
      HbA1c? METHODS: Each patient received a smartphone with an insulin dose advisor 
      (IDA) and with (G3 group) or without (G2 group) the 
      telemonitoring/teleconsultation function. Patients were classified as "high 
      users" if the proportion of "informed" meals using the IDA exceeded 67% (median) 
      and as "low users" if not. Also analyzed was the respective impact of the IDA 
      function and teleconsultations on the final HbA1c levels. RESULTS: Among the high 
      users, the proportion of informed meals remained stable from baseline to the end 
      of the study 6months later (from 78.1+/-21.5% to 73.8+/-25.1%; P=0.107), but 
      decreased in the low users (from 36.6+/-29.4% to 26.7+/-28.4%; P=0.005). As expected, 
      HbA1c improved in high users from 8.7% [range: 8.3-9.2%] to 8.2% [range: 
      7.8-8.7%] in patients with (n=26) vs without (n=30) the benefit of 
      telemonitoring/teleconsultation (-0.49+/-0.60% vs -0.52+/-0.73%, respectively; 
      P=0.879). However, although HbA1c also improved in low users from 9.0% [8.5-10.1] 
      to 8.5% [7.9-9.6], those receiving support via teleconsultation tended to show 
      greater improvement than the others (-0.93+/-0.97 vs -0.46+/-1.05, respectively; 
      P=0.084). CONCLUSION: The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high 
      and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement 
      was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.

TI  - Do European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet? 7-year 
      follow-up of the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study.
PG  - 1701-10
LID - 10.1007/s00394-012-0473-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Individuals with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of 
      developing cardiovascular diseases, and it has been reported that they consume a 
      high atherogenic diet. We examined how nutrient intake and adherence to current 
      European nutritional recommendations evolved in a large cohort of European 
      individuals with type 1 diabetes over a period of 7 years. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We 
      analysed data from the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study, a European 
      multicentre prospective cohort study. Standardized 3-day dietary records were 
      employed in individuals with type 1 diabetes. One thousand one hundred and two 
      patients (553 men, 549 women, baseline age 33 +/- 10 years, duration 15 +/- 9 years) 
      had complete nutritional data available at baseline and after 7 years. We 
      calculated mean differences in reported nutrients over time and adjusted these 
      for age, gender, HbA1c and BMI with ANOVA models. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, 
      there were minor changes in nutrients. Reported protein (-0.35% energy (en), fat 
      (-1.07% en), saturated fat (-0.25% en) and cholesterol (-7.42 mg/1000 kcal) 
      intakes were lower, whereas carbohydrate (+1.23% en) and fibre (+0.46 g/1000 
      kcal) intakes were higher at the 7-year follow-up. European recommendations for 
      adequate nutrient intakes were followed in individuals with type 1 diabetes for 
      protein (76% at baseline and 78% at follow-up), moderately for fat (34, 40%), 
      carbohydrate (34, 41%) and cholesterol (39, 47%), but poorly for fibre (1.4, 
      2.4%) and saturated fat (11, 13%). CONCLUSION: European individuals with type 1 
      diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for 
      dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary 
      nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs 
      particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat 
      to exploit their potential benefit.

TI  - Preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: is it a 
      prognostic factor?
PG  - 1115-22
LID - 10.1007/s00423-013-1111-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Platelet count is inversely related to prognosis in many cancers; 
      however, its role in esophageal cancer is still controversial. The purpose of 
      this study was to determine the prognostic value of preoperative platelet count 
      in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: From January 2006 to 
      December 2008, a retrospective analysis of 425 consecutive patients with ESCC was 
      conducted. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for survival 
      prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for preoperative 
      platelet count. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate 
      the prognostic parameters. RESULTS: A ROC curve for survival prediction was 
      plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for platelet count, which was 205 (x 
      10(9)/L). Patients with platelet count </= 205 had a significantly better 5-year 
      survival than patients with a platelet count >205 (60.7 vs. 31.6 %, P < 0.001). 
      The 5-year survival of patients either with platelet count </= 205 or >205 were 
      similar (68.6 vs. 58.8 %, P = 0.085) when the nodes were negative. However, the 
      5-year survival of patients with platelet count </= 205 was better than that of 
      patients with a platelet count >205 when the nodes were involved (32.0 vs. 12.7 
      %, P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed that platelet count (P = 0.013), T 
      grade (P = 0.017), and N staging (P < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term 
      survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 
      (x10(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting 
      survival in ESCC patients.

TI  - Should serum pancreatic lipase replace serum amylase as a biomarker of acute 
      pancreatitis?
PG  - 399-404
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum pancreatic lipase may improve the diagnosis of pancreatitis 
      compared to serum amylase. Both enzymes have been measured simultaneously at our 
      hospital allowing for a comparison of their diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: 
      Seventeen thousand five hundred and thirty-one measurements of either serum 
      amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase were made on 10 931 patients treated at a 
      metropolitan teaching hospital between January 2001 and May 2003. Of these, 8937 
      were initially treated in the Emergency Department. These results were collected 
      in a database, which was linked by the patients' medical record number to the 
      radiology and medical records. Patients with either an elevated lipase value or a 
      discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis had their radiological diagnosis 
      reviewed along with their biochemistry and histology record. The diagnosis of 
      acute pancreatitis was made if there was radiological evidence of peripancreatic 
      inflammation. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and twenty-five patients had 
      either elevated serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase. The medical records 
      coded for pancreatitis in a further 55 whose enzymes were not elevated. Three 
      hundred and twenty of these had radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis. 
      Receiver operator characteristic analysis of the initial sample from patients 
      received in the Emergency Department showed improved diagnostic accuracy for 
      serum pancreatic lipase (area under the curve (AUC) 0.948) compared with serum 
      amylase (AUC, 0.906, P < 0.05). A clinically useful cut-off point would be at the 
      diagnostic threshold; 208 U/L (normal <190 U/L) for serum pancreatic lipase and 
      114 U/L (normal 27-100 U/L) for serum amylase where the sensitivity was 90.3 cf., 
      76.8% and the specificity was 93 cf., 92.6%. 18.8% of the acute pancreatitis 
      patients did not have elevated serum amylase while only 2.9% did not have 
      elevated serum pancreatic lipase on the first emergency department measurement. 
      CONCLUSION: It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate 
      biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.

TI  - Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes 
      in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects?
PG  - 1738-44
LID - 10.2337/dc16-0302 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore whether electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can help 
      improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet 
      autoantibody-positive population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: TrialNet subjects 
      who were positive for one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, 
      GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin 
      autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit were analyzed; after 
      a median follow-up of 24 months, 177 of these 1,287 subjects developed diabetes. 
      RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays 
      (RIAs), ECL-IAA, ECL-GADA, age, sex, number of positive autoantibodies, presence 
      of HLA DR3/4-DQ8 genotype, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 
      measurements were all significantly associated with progression to diabetes. 
      Subjects who were ECL positive had a risk of progression to diabetes within 6 
      years of 58% compared with 5% for the ECL-negative subjects (P < 0.0001). 
      Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were compared, with the base model 
      including age, sex, OGTT measurements, and number of positive autoantibodies by 
      RIAs. The model with positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA was the best, and 
      factors that remained significantly associated with time to diabetes were area 
      under the curve (AUC) C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, number of 
      positive autoantibodies by RIAs, and ECL positivity. Adding ECL to the Diabetes 
      Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating 
      characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ECL assays 
      improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive 
      relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the 
      design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.

TI  - Does SYNTAX score predict in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation 
      myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention?
PG  - 806-13
LID - 10.5603/KP.a2014.0064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SYNTAX score (SxS) has been demonstrated to predict long-term 
      outcomes in stable patients with coronary artery disease. But its prognostic 
      value for patients with acute coronary syndrome remains unknown. AIM: To evaluate 
      whether SxS could predict in-hospital outcomes for patients admitted with ST 
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary 
      intervention (pPCI). METHODS: The study included 538 patients with STEMI who 
      underwent pPCI between January 2010 and December 2012. The patients were divided 
      into two groups: low SxS (< 22) and high SxS (> 22). The SxS of all patients was 
      calculated from aninitial angiogram and TIMI flow grade of infarct related artery 
      was calculated after pPCI. Left ventricular systolic functions of the patients 
      were evaluated with an echocardiogram in the following week. The rates of 
      reinfarction and mortality during hospitalisation were obtained from the medical 
      records of our hospital. RESULTS: The high SxS group had more no-reflow (41% and 
      25.1%, p < 0.001, respectively), lower ejection fraction (38.2 +/- 7.5% and 44.6 +/- 
      8.8%, p < 0.001, respectively), and greater rates of re-infarction (9.5% and 
      7.3%, p = 0.037, respectively) and mortality (0.9% and 0.2%, p = 0.021, 
      respectively) during hospitalisation compared to the low SxS group. On 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables, SxS was 
      an independent predictor of no-reflow (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.032-1.133, p = 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: SxS is a useful tool that can predict in-hospital outcomes of 
      patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI.

TI  - Are behavioural risk factors to be blamed for the conversion from optimal blood 
      pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans? A 5-year prospective 
      study.
PG  - 1114-23
LID - 10.1093/ije/dys106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Longitudinal cohort studies in sub-Saharan Africa are urgently needed 
      to understand cardiovascular disease development. We, therefore, explored health 
      behaviours and conventional risk factors of African individuals with optimal 
      blood pressure (BP) (</= 120/80 mm Hg), and their 5-year prediction for the 
      development of hypertension. METHODS: The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology 
      study in the North West Province, South Africa, started in 2005 and included 
      African volunteers (n = 1994; aged > 30 years) from a sample of 6000 randomly 
      selected households in rural and urban areas. RESULTS: At baseline, 48% of the 
      participants were hypertensive (>/= 140/90 mmHg). Those with optimal BP (n = 478) 
      were followed at a success rate of 70% for 5 years (213 normotensive, 68 
      hypertensive, 57 deceased). Africans that became hypertensive smoked more than 
      the normotensive individuals (68.2% vs 49.8%), and they also had a greater waist 
      circumference [ratio of geometric means of 0.94 cm (95% CI: 0.86-0.99)] and 
      greater amount of gamma-glutamyltransferase [0.74 U/l (95% CI: 0.62-0.88)] at 
      baseline. The 5-year change in BP was independently explained by baseline 
      gamma-glutamyltransferase [R(2) = 0.23, beta = 0.13 U/l (95% CI: 0.01-0.19)]. Alcohol 
      intake also predicted central systolic BP and carotid cross-sectional wall area 
      (CSWA) at follow-up. Waist circumference was another predictor of BP changes [beta = 
      0.18 cm (95% CI: 0.05-0.24)] and CSWA. HIV infection was inversely associated 
      with increased BP. CONCLUSIONS: During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal 
      BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely 
      explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus 
      aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health 
      system.

TI  - Does the type of tibial component affect mechanical alignment in unicompartmental 
      knee replacement?
PG  - 81-5
LID - 10.3233/THC-2012-00703 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There are a number of factors responsible for the longevity of 
      unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR). These include the magnitude of 
      postoperative alignment and the type of material used. The effect of component 
      design and material on postoperative alignment, however, has not been explored. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent UKR 
      with robotic guidance. Patients were divided into two groups, according to 
      whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a 
      metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of 
      mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. RESULTS: Mean 
      postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the 
      Onlay group (mean=2.8 degrees ; 95% CI=2.4 degrees , 3.2 degrees ) compared to the Inlay group 
      (mean=3.9 degrees ; 95% CI=3.4 degrees , 4.4 degrees ) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, 
      age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration 
      revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant 
      effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained 
      better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received 
      all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay 
      prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. 
      Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical 
      alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial 
      UKR.

TI  - Upstream solutions: does the supplemental security income program reduce 
      disability in the elderly?
PG  - 5-45
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2007.00512.x [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The robust relationship between socioeconomic factors and health 
      suggests that social and economic policies might substantially affect health, 
      while other evidence suggests that medical care, the main focus of current health 
      policy, may not be the primary determinant of population health. Income support 
      policies are one promising avenue to improve population health. This study 
      examines whether the federal cash transfer program to poor elderly, the 
      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, affects old-age disability. METHODS: 
      This study uses the 1990 and 2000 censuses, employing state and year fixed-effect 
      models, to test whether within-state changes in maximum SSI benefits over time 
      lead to changes in disability among people aged sixty-five and older. FINDINGS: 
      Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates. Among all single elderly 
      individuals, 30 percent have mobility limitations, and an increase of $100 per 
      month in the maximum SSI benefit caused the rate of mobility limitations to fall 
      by 0.46 percentage points. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. 
      First, analyses limited to those most likely to receive SSI produced larger 
      effects, but analyses limited to those least likely to receive SSI produced no 
      measurable effect. Second, varying the disability measure did not meaningfully 
      alter the findings. Third, excluding the institutionalized, immigrants, 
      individuals living in states with exceptionally large benefit changes, and 
      individuals living in states with no SSI supplements did not change the 
      substantive conclusions. Fourth, Medicaid did not confound the effects. Finally, 
      these results were robust for married individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Income support 
      policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially 
      that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further 
      analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine 
      a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader 
      range of social and economic policies affect health.

TI  - Can serum be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with 
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer?
PG  - 57-63
LID - 10.1097/COC.0b013e31823a5217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as prognostic or 
      predictive marker in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been 
      used widely. However, it may be difficult to get tumor tissue for analyzing the 
      status of EGFR mutation status in large proportion of patients with advanced 
      disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We obtained pairs of tumor and serum samples from 
      57 patients with advanced NSCLC, between March 2006 and January 2009. EGFR 
      mutation status from tumor samples was analyzed by genomic polymerase chain 
      reaction and direct sequence and EGFR mutation status from serum samples was 
      determined by the peptide nucleic acid locked nucleic acid polymerase chain 
      reaction clamp. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 
      patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients. EGFR mutation status in the 
      serum and tumor samples was consistent in 50 of the 57 pairs (87.7%). There was a 
      high correlation between the mutations detected in serum sample and the mutations 
      detected in the matched tumor sample (correlation index 0.62; P<0.001). 
      Twenty-two of 57 patients (38.5%) received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as any 
      line therapy. The response for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly 
      associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples (P<0.05). 
      There was no significant differences in overall survival according to the status 
      of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Serum 
      sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue 
      for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Are failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction associated with steep 
      posterior tibial slopes? A case control study.
PG  - 2649-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, increasing number of literature has identified the 
      posterior tibial slope (PTS) as one of the risk factors of primary anterior 
      cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, few studies concerning the association 
      between failure of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and PTS have been published. The 
      objective of this study was to explore the association between the failure of 
      ACLR and PTS at a minimum of two years follow-up. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty 
      eight eligible patients from June 2009 to October 2010 were identified from our 
      database. A total of 20 failure cases of ACLR and 20 randomly selected controls 
      were included in this retrospective study. The demographic data and the results 
      of manual maximum side-to-side difference with KT-1000 arthrometer at 30 degrees  of knee 
      flexion and pivot-shift test before the ACLR and at the final follow-up were 
      collected. The medial and lateral PTSs were measured using the magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) scan, based on Hudek's measurement. A comparison of PTS between the 
      two groups was performed. RESULTS: The overall failure rate of the present study 
      was 8.4%. Of the 40 participants, the mean medial PTS was 4.1 degrees  +/- 3.2 degrees  and the 
      mean lateral PTS was 4.6 degrees  +/- 2.6 degrees . The medial PTS of the ACLR failure group was 
      significantly steeper than the control group (3.5 degrees  +/- 2.5 degrees  vs. 6.1 degrees  +/- 2.1 degrees , P = 
      0.000). Similarly, the lateral PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly 
      steeper than the control group (2.9 degrees  +/- 2.1 degrees  vs. 5.5 degrees  +/- 3.0 degrees , P = 0.006). For 
      medial PTS >/= 5 degrees , the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 6.8 (P = 0.007); for lateral 
      PTS >/=5 degrees , the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 10.8 (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Both 
      medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the 
      control group. Medial or lateral PTS >/=5 degrees  was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.

TI  - Do teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural 
      towns?
PG  - 406-6.e6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the dose intensity and toxicity profiles for patients 
      undergoing chemotherapy at the Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC), a tertiary cancer 
      centre in northern Queensland, with those for patients treated in Mount Isa, 
      supervised by the same medical oncologists via teleoncology. DESIGN: A 
      quasi-experimental design comparing two patient groups. SETTING: TCC and Mount 
      Isa Hospital, which both operate under the auspices of the Townsville 
      Teleoncology Network (TTN). PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients who received 
      chemotherapy at TCC or Mt Isa Hospital between 1 May 2007 and 30 April 2012. 
      INTERVENTION: Teleoncology model for managing cancer patients in rural towns. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dose intensity (doses, number of cycles and lines of 
      treatment) and toxicity rates (rate of serious side effects, hospital admissions 
      and mortality). RESULTS: Over 5 years, 89 patients received a total of 626 cycles 
      of various chemotherapy regimens in Mount Isa. During the same period, 117 
      patients who received a total of 799 cycles of chemotherapy at TCC were eligible 
      for inclusion in the comparison group. There were no significant differences 
      between the Mount Isa and TCC patients in most demographic characteristics, mean 
      numbers of treatment cycles, dose intensities, proportions of side effects, and 
      hospital admissions. There were no toxicity-related deaths in either group. 
      CONCLUSION: It appears safe to administer chemotherapy in rural towns under the 
      supervision of medical oncologists from larger centres via teleoncology, provided 
      that rural health care resources and governance arrangements are adequate.

LID - S0022-5347(13)03689-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.juro.2013.03.042 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To our knowledge there are no evidence-based medicine data to date to 
      critically judge the vulnerability of a solitary kidney to warm ischemia compared 
      to paired kidneys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten dogs were exposed to open right 
      nephrectomy to create a solitary kidney model (group 1). Ten dogs with both 
      kidneys were considered group 2. All dogs underwent warm ischemia by open 
      occlusion of the left renal artery for 90 minutes. Dogs were sacrificed at 
      different intervals (3 days to 4 weeks). All dogs were reevaluated by renogram 
      before sacrifice and histopathology of the investigated kidney. The 
      proinflammatory markers CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were assessed using 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In group 1 clearance decreased by 
      20% at 1 week but basal function was regained starting at week 2. In group 2 
      clearance decreased more than 90% up to week 2. Recovery started at week 3 and by 
      4 weeks there was a 23% clearance reduction. Histopathological examination in 
      group 1 revealed significant tubular necrosis (60%) at 3 days with regeneration 
      starting at 1 week. In group 2 there was more pronounced tubular necrosis (90%) 
      with regeneration starting at 2 weeks. The expression of proinflammatory markers 
      was up-regulated in each group with higher, more sustained expression in group 2. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than 
      paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.

TI  - Is it safe to perform rectal anastomosis in gynaecological debulking surgery 
      without a diverting stoma?
PG  - 1142-1146
LID - 10.1111/codi.13364 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Colorectal resection is frequently performed during cytoreductive surgery 
      for gynaecological malignancy. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of 
      colorectal anastomosis, and especially low rectal anastomosis, in the absence of 
      a protective stoma in patients with gynaecological cancer and peritoneal 
      metastasis. METHOD: Patient data were retrospectively collected from a database 
      for gynaecological cancer procedures carried out between January 2013 and July 
      2015. All patients who underwent a colorectal resection during cytoreduction were 
      included in the study. The primary outcome was anastomotic leakage in the 
      presence or absence of a diverting stoma. Secondary outcome parameters were 
      complications and reoperations. RESULTS: In the period of study, 43 major 
      colorectal procedures were performed on 37 women. The most common colorectal 
      procedure was low rectal resection (n = 22; 59%) followed by anterior rectal 
      resection (n = 7; 19%) and sigmoid resection (n = 4; 11%). Five (14%) patients 
      underwent Hartmann's procedure. In three (8%) patients, a diverting loop 
      ileostomy was created. CONCLUSION: Low rectal resection during debulking 
      procedures for gynaecological cancers with peritoneal carcinomatosis can safely 
      be performed by an experienced surgeon without a diverting stoma.

TI  - Has the mammography quality standards act affected the mammography quality in 
      North Carolina?
PG  - 1089-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The United States Food and Drug Administration implemented federal 
      regulations governing mammography under the Mammography Quality Standards Act 
      (MQSA) of 1992. During 1995, its first year in implementation, we examined the 
      impact of the MQSA on the quality of mammography in North Carolina. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: All mammography facilities were inspected during 1993-1994, and again in 
      1995. Both inspections evaluated mean glandular radiation dose, phantom image 
      evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature. Two mammography health 
      specialists employed by the North Carolina Division of Radiation Protection 
      performed all inspections and collected and codified data. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of facilities that met quality standards increased from the first 
      inspection to the second inspection. Phantom scores passing rate was 31.6% versus 
      78.2%; darkroom fog passing rate was 74.3% versus 88.5%; and temperature 
      difference passing rate was 62.4% versus 86.9%. CONCLUSION: In 1995, the first 
      year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the 
      quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from 
      facilities' compliance with federal regulations.

TI  - Is breast cancer prognosis inherited?
PG  - R39
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A genetic component is well established in the etiology of breast 
      cancer. It is not well known, however, whether genetic traits also influence 
      prognostic features of the malignant phenotype. METHODS: We carried out a 
      population-based cohort study in Sweden based on the nationwide Multi-Generation 
      Register. Among all women with breast cancer diagnosed from 1961 to 2001, 2,787 
      mother-daughter pairs and 831 sister pairs with breast cancer were identified; we 
      achieved complete follow-up and classified 5-year breast cancer-specific 
      prognosis among proband (mother or oldest sister) into tertiles as poor, 
      intermediary, or good. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival proportions and 
      Cox models to calculate relative risks of dying from breast cancer within 5 years 
      depending on the proband's outcome. RESULTS: The 5-year survival proportion among 
      daughters whose mothers died within 5 years was 87% compared to 91% if the mother 
      was alive (p = 0.03). Among sisters, the corresponding proportions were 70% and 
      88%, respectively (p = 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, 
      daughters and sisters of a proband with poor prognosis had a 60% higher 5-year 
      breast cancer mortality compared to those of a proband with good prognosis 
      (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.2; p for trend 
      0.002). This association was slightly stronger among sisters (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 
      1.0 to 3.4) than among daughters (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3). CONCLUSION: 
      Breast cancer prognosis of a woman predicts the survival in her first-degree 
      relatives with breast cancer. Our novel findings suggest that breast cancer 
      prognosis might be inherited.

TI  - c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells: a potential therapeutic target?
PG  - 2075-82
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate the expression and functional 
      impact of the proto-oncogene c-kit in uveal melanoma. METHODS: Based on 
      immunohistochemical (IHC) study of paraffin-embedded specimens from 134 uveal 
      melanomas and Western blot analysis on eight fresh-frozen samples the expression 
      of c-kit in uveal melanoma was studied. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit 
      and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three 
      uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1. RESULTS: Eighty-four of 134 
      paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. 
      c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal 
      melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to 
      cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in 
      serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 
      of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth 
      factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, 
      suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment 
      of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, 
      resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit 
      phosphorylation and cell proliferation was of equal size and less than 2.5 
      microM. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal 
      melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal 
      melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.

TI  - Pituitary apoplexy: do histological features influence the clinical presentation 
      and outcome?
PG  - 931-7
AB  - OBJECT: A retrospective analysis of a contemporary series of patients with 
      pituitary apoplexy was performed to ascertain whether the histopathological 
      features influence the clinical presentation or the outcome. METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis was performed in 59 patients treated for pituitary 
      apoplexy at the University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia, 
      or Groote Schuur Hospital, University of Cape Town, South Africa. The patients 
      were divided into two groups according to the histological features of their 
      disease: one group with infarction alone, comprising 22 patients; and the other 
      with hemorrhagic infarction and/or frank hemorrhage, comprising 37 patients. The 
      presenting symptoms, clinical features, endocrinological status, and outcome were 
      compared between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The patients who presented with 
      histological features of pituitary tumor infarction alone had less severe 
      clinical features on presentation, a longer course prior to presentation, and a 
      better outcome than those presenting with hemorrhagic infarction or frank 
      hemorrhage. The endocrine replacement requirements were similar in both groups.

TI  - Orthostatic myoclonus: an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness?
PG  - 1013-7
LID - S1353-8020(13)00256-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2013.07.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) has been suggested 
      as a cause of gait impairment and unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its 
      clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders. 
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface 
      recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was 
      performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was 
      observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second </=16). RESULTS: Among 93 
      subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n = 16; 17.2%), followed by 
      orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). 
      All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or 
      during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during 
      orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 
      patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as 
      multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease 
      (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 
      2). Although four subjects showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with 
      antimyoclonic treatment, the follow-up was not systematic enough to evaluate 
      their therapeutic effect on OM. CONCLUSIONS: Orthostatic myoclonus is often 
      underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects 
      with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an 
      aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.

TI  - Is low serum chloride level a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality?
PG  - 177-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum chloride level is routinely assayed in clinical laboratories in 
      the management of patients with kidney disorders and with metabolic diseases. It 
      is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply 
      measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been 
      studied before. METHODS: For the random sample of men and women from the Belgian 
      Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of 
      symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations 
      were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 
      10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: The 
      results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox 
      regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of 
      total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, 
      body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total 
      proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of 
      levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated 
      adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level < or 
      =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% 
      confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 
      1.11-4.22) for women. The study of adjusted risk ratios for four groups of 
      subjects defined on the basis of their baseline serum chloride levels revealed a 
      decreasing log-linear 'dose-response' relation to total and cardiovascular 
      mortalities. CONCLUSION: This s the first report from a population-based study to 
      indicate that there is an association between serum chloride level and the 
      incidence of total, CVD and non-CVD mortalities. The risk ratio for CVD mortality 
      associated with a low serum chloride level was comparable to or higher than those 
      observed for well-established CVD risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ageing is a growing issue for people from UK black, Asian and 
      minority ethnic (BAME) groups. The health experiences of these groups are 
      recognised as a 'tracer' to measure success in end of life patient-preferred 
      outcomes that includes place of death (PoD). AIM: To examine patterns in PoD 
      among BAME groups who died of cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mortality data for 
      93,375 cancer deaths of those aged >/=65 years in London from 2001-2010 were 
      obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Decedent's country of 
      birth was used as a proxy for ethnicity. Linear regression examined trends in 
      place of death across the eight ethnic groups and Poisson regression examined the 
      association between country of birth and place of death. RESULTS: 76% decedents 
      were born in the UK, followed by Ireland (5.9%), Europe(5.4%) and 
      Caribbean(4.3%). Most deaths(52.5%) occurred in hospital, followed by 
      home(18.7%). During the study period, deaths in hospital declined with an 
      increase in home deaths; trend for time analysis for those born in 
      UK(0.50%/yr[0.36-0.64%]p<0.001), Europe (1.00%/yr[0.64-1.30%]p<0.001), 
      Asia(1.09%/yr[0.94-1.20%]p<0.001) and Caribbean(1.03%/yr[0.72-1.30%]p<0.001). 
      However, time consistent gaps across the geographical groups remained. Following 
      adjustment hospital deaths were more likely for those born in Asia(Proportion 
      ratio(PR)1.12[95%CI1.08-1.15]p<0.001) and Africa(PR 1.11[95%CI1.07-1.16]p<0.001). 
      Hospice deaths were less likely for those born in Asia(PR 0.73 [0.68-0.80] 
      p<0.001), Africa (PR 0.83[95%CI0.74-0.93]p<0.001), and 'other' geographical 
      regions (PR0.90[95% 0.82-0.98]p<0.001). Home deaths were less likely for those 
      born in the Caribbean(PR0.91[95%CI 0.85-0.98]p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Location of 
      death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a 
      hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is 
      needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred 
      preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will 
      enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care 
      and related services, where necessary.

TI  - Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in 
      brain-dead patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for 
      transplantation?
PG  - 708-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The brain-dead donor supply has become one of the criteria limiting 
      the performance of heart transplantation. Conventional screening criteria are too 
      limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely 
      available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in 
      brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular 
      dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. METHODS: Fifty-five potential 
      brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by 
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change 
      (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead 
      donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The 
      transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not 
      retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more 
      than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. RESULTS: Of the 55 
      potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were 
      harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC 
      below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 
      from hemorrhage (FAC > 50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular 
      dysfunction (FAC < 50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 
      15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in 
      recipients. Overall actuarial survival was 86.2% versus 64.6% at 1 and 2 years in 
      group H1 and group H2, respectively (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: TEE is useful to 
      assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 
      50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular 
      dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% 
      may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.

TI  - [Can the postoperative pain level be predicted preoperatively?].
PG  - 541-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: We searched for factors present preoperatively which could 
      be used to predict the intensity of postoperative pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We 
      undertook a prospective study among all patients aged over 18 years who underwent 
      shoulder surgery from January to September 2004 in our unit. The study included 
      86 patients for which the following data were noted preoperatively: past history 
      of pain, intensity and duration of prior pain, triggering factors, localization, 
      psychological context. The intensity of the postoperative pain was measured on a 
      visual analog scale (VAS); measurements were noted up to 24 hours postop then at 
      one month. Data processing was performed with Statview5.5. RESULTS: Significant 
      postoperative pain was correlated with a prior history of surgical pain, with 
      duration of prior pain, with intensity of preoperative pain, and with depression. 
      DISCUSSION: Significant sustained preoperative pain can favor memory of pain 
      leading to postoperative sensitivization of nociception neurons. Intense 
      postoperative pain can favor the development of refractory chronic pain. 
      CONCLUSION: Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following 
      situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more 
      than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine age-related differences in the relationship between 
      personality and coping strategies in an Australian population of psychiatric 
      inpatients. METHOD: Consenting eligible adults (N=238) from 18-100 years of age 
      consecutively admitted to inpatient psychiatry units were assessed using the SCID 
      I and II, the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Scale (COPE), the Brief 
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale 
      (GAF), the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), the 12 
      Item Short-Form Heath Survey (SF12), the Sarason Social Support Questionnaire, 
      and the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (cognitively impaired, and 
      non-English speaking patients were excluded). RESULTS: Older adults reported less 
      symptomatology than younger patients and younger patients described more 
      personality dysfunction than older patients. As assessed by the COPE, older 
      adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger 
      adults. Personality traits, social supports, gender, and age predicted coping 
      strategies, while Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom 
      severity were not significant predictors of coping strategies. CONCLUSION: This 
      study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. 
      These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping 
      strategies.

TI  - Is neck pain associated with worse health-related quality of life 6 months later? 
      A population-based cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Current evidence suggests that neck pain is negatively 
      associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, these studies 
      are cross-sectional and do not inform the association between neck pain and 
      future HRQoL. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      association between increasing grades of neck pain severity and HRQoL 6 months 
      later. In addition, this longitudinal study examines the crude association 
      between the course of neck pain and HRQoL. STUDY DESIGN: This is a 
      population-based cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Eleven hundred randomly sampled 
      Saskatchewan adults were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were the 
      mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of the 
      Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. METHODS: We formed a cohort of 1,100 
      randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain 
      Questionnaire to measure neck pain and its related disability. The SF-36 
      questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL 6 months later. 
      Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between 
      graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for confounding. Analysis of 
      variance and t tests were used to measure the crude association among four 
      possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The neck pain trajectories 
      over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck pain, worsening neck 
      pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of variance was used to examine 
      changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores among the four neck pain 
      trajectory groups. RESULTS: The 6-month follow-up rate was 74.9%. We found an 
      exposure-response relationship between neck pain and physical HRQoL after 
      adjusting for age, education, arthritis, low back pain, and depressive 
      symptomatology. Compared with participants without neck pain at baseline, those 
      with mild (beta=-1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]=-2.83, -0.24), intense (beta=-3.60, 
      95% CI=-5.76, -1.44), or disabling (beta=-8.55, 95% CI=-11.68, -5.42) neck pain had 
      worse physical HRQoL 6 months later. We did not find an association between neck 
      pain and mental HRQoL. A worsening course of neck pain and persistent neck pain 
      were associated with worse physical HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: We found that neck pain 
      was negatively associated with physical but not mental HRQoL. Our analysis 
      suggests that neck pain may be a contributor of future poor physical HRQoL in the 
      population. Raising awareness of the possible future impact of neck pain on 
      physical HRQoL is important for health-care providers and policy makers with 
      respect to the management of neck pain in populations.

TI  - Dose end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement correlate with arterial carbon dioxide 
      in extremely low birth weight infants in the first week of life?
PG  - 20-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation and agreement between end-tidal carbon 
      dioxide (EtCO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) in ventilated extremely low 
      birth weight (ELBW) infants in the first week of life. METHODS: Retrospective 
      chart review of all ELBW (<1,000 g) infants admitted to a level III NICU from 
      January 2003 to December 2003. Data collected included demographic details and 
      simultaneous EtCO(2) (mainstream capnography) and arterial blood gas values (pH, 
      PaCO(2), PaO(2)). OUTCOME: The correlation coefficient, degree of bias with 95% 
      confidence interval between the EtCO(2) and PaCO(2). RESULTS: There were 754 
      end-tidal and arterial CO(2) pairs from 31 ELBW infants (21 male and 10 female). 
      The overall EtCO(2) values were significantly lower than PaCO(2) value. In only 
      89/754(11.8%) pairs, the EtCO(2) was higher than the PaCO(2). The overall bias 
      was 5.6 +/- 6.9 mmHg (95% C.I. 5.11-6.09). The intraclass correlation coefficient 
      was 0.81. Using EtCO2 ranges of 30 to 50 mmHg, the capnographic method was able 
      to identify 84% of instances where PaCO(2) was between 35 (<35 = hypocarbia) and 
      55 mmHg (>55= hypercapnia). CONCLUSIONS: There is good correlation and agreement 
      between end-tidal CO(2) and arterial CO(2) in ELBW infants in the EtCO(2) range 
      30-50 mmHg. End-tidal CO(2) monitoring can be helpful in trending or for 
      screening abnormal PaCO(2) values in ELBW infants in first week of life.

TI  - Does Residency Selection Criteria Predict Performance in Orthopaedic Surgery 
      Residency?
PG  - 908-14
LID - 10.1007/s11999-015-4317-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 1000 candidates applied for orthopaedic residency positions 
      in 2014, and the competition is intense; approximately one-third of the 
      candidates failed to secure a position in the match. However, the criteria used 
      in the selection process often are subjective and studies have differed in terms 
      of which criteria predict either objective measures or subjective ratings of 
      resident performance by faculty. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Do preresidency selection 
      factors serve as predictors of success in residency? Specifically, we asked which 
      preresidency selection factors are associated or correlated with (1) objective 
      measures of resident knowledge and performance; and (2) subjective ratings by 
      faculty. METHODS: Charts of 60 orthopaedic residents from our institution were 
      reviewed. Preresidency selection criteria examined included United States Medical 
      Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission 
      Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of 
      recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical 
      society membership, fourth-year subinternship at our institution, and number of 
      publications. Resident performance was assessed using objective measures 
      including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and 
      Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores and subjective ratings by faculty 
      including global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents. We tested 
      associations between preresidency criteria and the subsequent objective and 
      subjective metrics using linear correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney tests when 
      appropriate. RESULTS: Objective measures of resident performance namely, ABOS 
      Part I scores, had a moderate linear correlation with the USMLE Step 2 scores (r 
      = 0.55, p < 0.001) and number of clinical honors received in medical school (r = 
      0.45, p < 0.001). OITE scores had a weak linear correlation with the number of 
      clinical honors (r = 0.35, p = 0.009) and USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.29, p = 
      0.02). With regards to subjective outcomes, AOA membership was associated with 
      higher scores on the global evaluation (p = 0.005). AOA membership also 
      correlated with higher global evaluation scores (r = 0.60, p = 0.005) with the 
      strongest correlation existing between AOA membership and the "interpersonal and 
      communication skills" subsection of the global evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: We found 
      that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA 
      membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our 
      goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense 
      of which criteria may be "high yield" in ranking applicants by analyzing data 
      from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of 
      programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually 
      emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing 
      importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of 
      orthopaedic residents.

TI  - Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian 
      endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?
PG  - 331-5
LID - 10.1155/2013/984641 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring 
      pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy 
      ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis 
      in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid 
      unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with 
      high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating 
      ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to 
      establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential 
      diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: 
      Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas 
      and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. RESULTS: High CA125 concentrations were 
      observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. 
      A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian 
      cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study suggests that CA72-4 determination can be useful to confirm the benign 
      nature of ovarian endometriomas in women with high CA125 levels.

TI  - Is the breast best for children with a family history of atopy? The relation 
      between way of feeding and early childhood morbidity.
PG  - 471-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported that breast-feeding protects children 
      against a variety of diseases, but these studies were generally conducted on 
      "high-risk" or hospitalized children. This paper describes the results of our 
      study on the effects of breast-feeding on rate of illness in normal children with 
      a family history of atopy. METHODS: A historic cohort approach of 794 children 
      with a family history of atopy was used to assess the effects of breast-feeding 
      on illness rates. Family history of atopy was based on allergic diseases in 
      family members as registered by the family physician. Illness data from birth 
      onwards were available from the Continuous Morbidity Registration of the 
      Department of Family Medicine. Information on breast-feeding was collected by 
      postal questionnaire. We then compared rates of illness between children with a 
      family history of atopy who were and who were not breast-fed. RESULTS: 
      Breast-feeding was related to lower levels of childhood illness both in the first 
      and the first three years of life. In the first year of life they had fewer 
      episodes of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive 
      tract disorders. Over the next three years of life they had fewer respiratory 
      tract infections and skin infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a 
      protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy 
      that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the 
      first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a 
      family history of atopy.

TI  - Is Bare-Metal Stent Implantation Still Justifiable in High Bleeding Risk Patients 
      Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?: A Pre-Specified Analysis From the 
      ZEUS Trial.
PG  - 426-36
LID - S1936-8798(15)01751-3 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the ischemic and bleeding outcomes 
      of patients fulfilling high bleeding risk (HBR) criteria who were randomized to 
      zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint stent (E-ZES) or bare-metal stent (BMS) 
      implantation followed by an abbreviated dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration 
      for stable or unstable coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND: DES instead of BMS 
      use remains controversial in HBR patients, in whom long-term DAPT poses safety 
      concerns. METHODS: The ZEUS (Zotarolimus-Eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent in 
      Uncertain DES Candidates) is a multinational, randomized single-blinded trial 
      that randomized among others, in a stratified manner, 828 patients fulfilling 
      pre-defined clinical or biochemical HBR criteria-including advanced age, 
      indication to oral anticoagulants or other pro-hemorrhagic medications, history 
      of bleeding and known anemia-to receive E-ZES or BMS followed by a 
      protocol-mandated 30-day DAPT regimen. The primary endpoint of the study was the 
      12-month major adverse cardiovascular event rate, consisting of death, myocardial 
      infarction, or target vessel revascularization. RESULTS: Compared with patients 
      without, those with 1 or more HBR criteria had worse outcomes, owing to higher 
      ischemic and bleeding risks. Among HBR patients, major adverse cardiovascular 
      events occurred in 22.6% of the E-ZES and 29% of the BMS patients (hazard ratio: 
      0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.98; p = 0.033), driven by lower 
      myocardial infarction (3.5% vs. 10.4%; p < 0.001) and target vessel 
      revascularization (5.9% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.005) rates in the E-ZES arm. The 
      composite of definite or probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced in 
      E-ZES recipients, whereas bleeding events did not differ between stent groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among HBR patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease, 
      E-ZES implantation provides superior efficacy and safety as compared with 
      conventional BMS. (Zotarolimus-Eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent in Uncertain DES

TI  - Marital status, living arrangement and mortality: does the association vary by 
      gender?
PG  - e22
LID - 10.1136/jech.2010.128397 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Men appear to benefit more from being married than women with respect 
      to mortality in middle age. However, there is some uncertainty about gender 
      differences in mortality risks in older individuals, widowed, divorced and single 
      individuals and about the impact of living arrangements. METHODS: Longitudinal 
      data with 1990 census records being linked to mortality data up to 2005 were used 
      (Swiss National Cohort). The sample comprised all residents over age 44 years in 
      Switzerland (n=2,440,242). All-cause mortality HRs for marital status and living 
      arrangements were estimated by Cox regression for men and women and different age 
      groups with adjustment for education and socio-professional category. RESULTS: 
      The benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women; however, 
      mortality patterns were similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single 
      individuals compared with widowed individuals (<80 years). After adjustment for 
      living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. 
      Stratification by living arrangement revealed that mortality risks were highest 
      for 45-64-year-old divorced (HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.76)) and single men (HR 
      1.67 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.71)) who lived alone. In women of the same age, the 
      highest mortality risk was observed for those who were single and living with a 
      partner (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.82)). In older age groups, the impact of 
      marital status decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of living arrangements is 
      crucial for identifying and explaining gender differences in mortality risks by 
      marital status. The impact of living alone and living with a partner seems to be 
      different in men and women.

TI  - Does ibuprofen increase perioperative blood loss during hip arthroplasty?
PG  - 829-31
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prior exposure of non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs increases perioperative blood loss associated with major 
      orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Fifty patients scheduled for total hip replacement 
      were allocated to two groups (double blind, randomized manner). All patients were 
      pretreated for 2 weeks before surgery: Group 1 with placebo drug, Group 2 with 
      ibuprofen. All patients were injected intrathecally with bupivacaine 20mg plus 
      morphine 0.1 mg, in a total volume of 4 mL, to provide surgical anaesthesia. 
      RESULTS: The presence of severe adverse effects caused eight patients in the 
      ibuprofen group and six in the placebo group to terminate their participation in 
      the trial. The perioperative blood loss increased by 45% in the ibuprofen group 
      compared with placebo. The total (+/-SD) blood loss in the ibuprofen group was 
      1161 (+/-472) mL versus 796 (+/-337) mL in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pretreatment with ibuprofen before elective total hip surgery increases the 
      perioperative blood loss significantly. Early discontinuation of non-selective 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is advised.

TI  - Can magnetic resonance imaging accurately predict concordant pain provocation 
      during provocative disc injection?
PG  - 877-85
LID - 10.1007/s00256-009-0709-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To correlate magnetic resonance (MR) image findings with pain response 
      by provocation discography in patients with discogenic low back pain, with an 
      emphasis on the combination analysis of a high intensity zone (HIZ) and disc 
      contour abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients (aged 17-68 
      years) with axial low back pain that was likely to be disc related underwent 
      lumbar discography (178 discs tested). The MR images were evaluated for disc 
      degeneration, disc contour abnormalities, HIZ, and endplate abnormalities. Based 
      on the combination of an HIZ and disc contour abnormalities, four classes were 
      determined: (1) normal or bulging disc without HIZ; (2) normal or bulging disc 
      with HIZ; (3) disc protrusion without HIZ; (4) disc protrusion with HIZ. These MR 
      image findings and a new combined MR classification were analyzed in the base of 
      concordant pain determined by discography. RESULTS: Disc protrusion with HIZ 
      [sensitivity 45.5%; specificity 97.8%; positive predictive value (PPV), 87.0%] 
      correlated significantly with concordant pain provocation (P < 0.01). A normal or 
      bulging disc with HIZ was not associated with reproduction of pain. Disc 
      degeneration (sensitivity 95.4%; specificity 38.8%; PPV 33.9%), disc protrusion 
      (sensitivity 68.2%; specificity 80.6%; PPV 53.6%), and HIZ (sensitivity 56.8%; 
      specificity 83.6%; PPV 53.2%) were not helpful in the identification of a disc 
      with concordant pain. CONCLUSION: The proposed MR classification is useful to 
      predict a disc with concordant pain. Disc protrusion with HIZ on MR imaging 
      predicted positive discography in patients with discogenic low back pain.

TI  - Does case-mix based reimbursement stimulate the development of process-oriented 
      care delivery?
PG  - 74-80
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.06.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Reimbursement based on the total care of a patient during an acute 
      episode of illness is believed to stimulate management and clinicians to reduce 
      quality problems like waiting times and poor coordination of care delivery. 
      Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement 
      leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved 
      as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement 
      stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a 
      process-oriented way of working. METHODS: Data for this study were gathered 
      during the winter of 2007/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. 
      Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted. 
      RESULTS: SEM reveals that adoption of the case-mix reimbursement within 
      hospitals' budgeting processes stimulates hospitals to establish care programmes 
      by the use of process-oriented performance measures. However, the implementation 
      of care programmes is not (yet) accompanied by a change in focus from function 
      (the delivery of independent care activities) to process (the delivery of care 
      activities as being connected to a chain of interdependent care activities). 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that hospital management can stimulate the 
      development of care programmes by the adoption of case-mix reimbursement within 
      hospitals' budgeting processes. Future research is recommended to confirm this 
      finding and to determine whether the establishment of care programmes will in 
      time indeed lead to a more process-oriented view of professionals.

TI  - [Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller 
      syndrome: a causative link?].
PG  - 1111-6
LID - 10.1016/j.neurol.2008.08.014 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging 
      countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary 
      localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the 
      occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has 
      not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable 
      Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this 
      syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis. CASE REPORT: A seven-year-old girl 
      presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since 
      birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), 
      microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child 
      had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, 
      loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the 
      spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal 
      reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch 
      bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An 
      extensive immunological work-up was normal. CONCLUSION: [corrected] This 
      observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of 
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare 
      congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this 
      entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.

TI  - Is the determination of specific IgE against components using ISAC 112 a 
      reproducible technique?
PG  - e88394

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 is a fluoro-immunoassay that allows detection 
      of specific IgE to 112 molecular components from 51 allergenic sources. We 
      studied the reliability of this technique intra- and inter- assay, as well as 
      inter-batch- and inter-laboratory-assay. METHODS: Twenty samples were studied, 
      nineteen sera from polysensitized allergic patients, and the technique calibrator 
      provided by the manufacturer (CTR02). We measured the sIgE from CTR02 and three 
      patients' sera ten times in the same and in different assays. Furthermore, all 
      samples were tested in two laboratories and with two batches of ISAC kit. To 
      evaluate the accuracy of ISAC 112, we contrasted the determinations of CTR02 
      calibrator with their expected values by T Student test. To analyse the 
      precision, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the 15 allergens 
      that generate the calibration curve, and to analyse the repeatability and the 
      reproducibility, we calculated the intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to 
      each allergen. RESULTS: The results obtained for CTR02 were similar to those 
      expected in 7 of 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, whereas in 8 
      allergens the results showed significant differences. The mean CV obtained in the 
      CTR02 determinations was of 9.4%, and the variability of sera from patients was 
      of 22.9%. The agreement in the intra- and inter-assay analysis was very good to 
      94 allergens and good to one. In the inter-batch analyse, we obtained a very good 
      agreement to 82 allergens, good to 14, moderate to 5 allergens, poor to one, and 
      bad to 1 allergen. In the inter-laboratory analyse, we obtained a very good 
      agreement to 73 allergens, good to 22, moderate to 6 and poor to two allergens. 
      CONCLUSION: The allergen microarray immunoassay, ISAC 112, is a repeatable and 
      reproducible in vitro diagnostic tool for determination of sIgE beyond the own 
      laboratory.

TI  - Schizophrenia patients with high intelligence: A clinically distinct sub-type of 
      schizophrenia?
PG  - 628-32

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia patients are typically found to have low IQ both pre- 
      and post-onset, in comparison to the general population. However, a subgroup of 
      patients displays above average IQ pre-onset. The nature of these patients' 
      illness and its relationship to typical schizophrenia is not well understood. The 
      current study sought to investigate the symptom profile of high-IQ schizophrenia 
      patients. METHODS: We identified 29 schizophrenia patients of exceptionally high 
      pre-morbid intelligence (mean estimated pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ) of 
      120), of whom around half also showed minimal decline (less than 10 IQ points) 
      from their estimated pre-morbid IQ. We compared their symptom scores (SAPS, SANS, 
      OPCRIT, MADRS, GAF, SAI-E) with a comparison group of schizophrenia patients of 
      typical IQ using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: The patients with very 
      high pre-morbid IQ had significantly lower scores on negative and disorganised 
      symptoms than typical patients (RRR=0.019; 95% CI=0.001, 0.675, P=0.030), and 
      showed better global functioning and insight (RRR=1.082; 95% CI=1.020, 1.148; 
      P=0.009). Those with a minimal post-onset IQ decline also showed higher levels of 
      manic symptoms (RRR=8.213; 95% CI=1.042, 64.750, P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia 
      that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical 
      schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum 
      over boundaried diagnostic categories.

TI  - Is halofantrine ototoxic? Experimental study on guinea pig cochlea model.
PG  - 1061-6
LID - 10.1017/S0022215110001301 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Halofantrine is a newly developed antimalarial drug used for the 
      treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The introduction of this drug has 
      been delayed because of its possible side effects, and due to insufficient 
      studies on adverse reactions in humans. There have been no studies investigating 
      its effect on hearing. METHODS: Thirty guinea pigs were divided into three 
      groups: a control group, a halofantrine therapeutic dose group and a halofantrine 
      double therapeutic dose group. One cochlea specimen from each animal was stained 
      with haematoxylin and eosin and the other with toluidine blue. RESULTS: No 
      changes were detected in the control group. The halofantrine therapeutic dose 
      group showed loss and distortion of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells, 
      and loss of spiral ganglia cells. In the halofantrine double therapeutic dose 
      group, the inner and outer hair cells were distorted and there was loss of spiral 
      ganglia cells. CONCLUSION: Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects 
      on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.

TI  - Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale 
      matter?
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/1476-072X-9-35 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper investigates the impact of geographic scale (census tract, 
      zip code, and county) on the detection of disparities in breast cancer mortality 
      among three ethnic groups in Texas (period 1995-2005). Racial disparities were 
      quantified using both relative (RR) and absolute (RD) statistics that account for 
      the population size and correct for unreliable rates typically observed for 
      minority groups and smaller geographic units. Results were then correlated with 
      socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the 
      poverty level. RESULTS: African-American and Hispanic women generally experience 
      higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially 
      significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. 
      The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed 
      depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level. The 
      largest proportion of significant results was observed for the RD statistic and 
      census tract data. Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for 
      African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study investigates both relative and absolute racial 
      disparities in breast cancer mortality between White non-Hispanic and 
      African-American/Hispanic women at the census tract, zip code and county levels. 
      Analysis at the census tract level generally led to a larger proportion of 
      geographical units experiencing significantly higher mortality rates for minority 
      groups, although results varied depending on the use of the relative versus 
      absolute statistics. Additional research is needed before general conclusions can 
      be formulated regarding the choice of optimal geographic regions for the 
      detection of racial disparities.

TI  - Can fractional lasers enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an 
      in vivo animal model?
PG  - 168-74
LID - 10.1002/lsm.21130 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been shown in vitro that pretreatment of skin 
      with fractional lasers enhances transdermal delivery of drugs. The aim of this 
      study is to demonstrate in vivo firstly that laser enhances transdermal drug 
      absorption and secondly that this can be manipulated by altering laser settings. 
      STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four pigs were used in the IACUC approved 
      animal study. On day 0, 5 g of 4% topical lidocaine was applied under occlusion 
      for 60 minutes to a 400 cm(2) area on the abdomen. Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 90, 
      120, 180, and 240 minutes. On day 7, the Er:YAG laser was used at 500, 250, 50, 
      and 25 microm ablative depth, respectively, over a 400 cm(2) area on the abdomen. 
      Five grams of 4% topical lidocaine was applied immediately with occlusion for 60 
      minutes, and then removed. Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 
      minutes. The serum was extracted and analyzed for lidocaine and its metabolite 
      monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX). RESULTS: Serum levels of lidocaine and MEGX were 
      undetectable in untreated skin. Following laser treatment both lidocaine and MEGX 
      were detectable. Peak levels of lidocaine were significantly higher (P = 0.0002) 
      at 250 microm (0.62 mg/L), compared to 500 microm (0.45 mg/L), 50 microm (0.48 mg/L), and 25 
      microm (0.3 mg/L). Peak levels of MEGX were significantly higher (P </= 0.0001) at 250 
      microm (0.048 mg/L), compared to 500 microm (0.018 mg/L), 50 microm (0.036 mg/L), and 25 microm 
      (0.0144 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment 
      significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable 
      in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. 
      Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.

TI  - Does laparoscopic surgery decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation after foregut 
      surgery?
PG  - 204-8
LID - 10.1007/s00464-008-9800-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation, which occurs in 12% of all major foregut 
      surgeries, can prolong hospital stay and increase morbidity. Minimally invasive 
      techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We 
      examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut 
      surgery at our institution. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the records of 
      154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included 
      esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or 
      transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk 
      factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: Of the 154 patients, 14 
      patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 
      years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic 
      (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk 
      of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid 
      (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 
      103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. 
      The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer: 7.5 +/- 6.8 
      days versus 4.0 +/- 7.1 days (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed an 
      association of atrial fibrillation with age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14, p = 
      0.01), and laparoscopic surgery (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.95, p = 0.04) after 
      adjusting for surgery type. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery is associated with 
      lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial 
      fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We 
      recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings.

TI  - Is breast cancer survival improving?
PG  - 44-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite advances in therapies for breast cancer, improvement in 
      survival for patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer has been 
      difficult to establish. The objective of the current study was to determine 
      whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 
      to 2000. METHODS: The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who 
      developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All 
      patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. 
      Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer 
      recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some 
      prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a 
      multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence 
      and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. RESULTS: In the 
      unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in 
      survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival 
      (P < 0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer 
      recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer 
      lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive 
      tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate 
      analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was 
      associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for 
      each increasing year. CONCLUSIONS: For these cohorts of patients, the authors 
      present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast 
      cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.

TI  - Does partial expander deflation exacerbate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in 
      two-stage breast reconstruction?
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1186/1477-7819-10-44 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimum protocol for expander volume adjustment with respect to 
      the timing and application of radiotherapy remains controversial. METHODS: 
      Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. Metallic port 
      integrated anatomic breast expanders of 250 cc were implanted on the back of each 
      animal and controlled expansion was performed. Group I underwent radiotherapy 
      with full expanders while in Group II, expanders were partially deflated 
      immediately prior to radiotherapy. Control group did not receive radiotherapy.The 
      changes in blood flow at different volume adjustments were investigated in Group 
      II by laser Doppler flowmetry. Variations in the histopathologic properties of 
      the irradiated tissues including the skin, capsule and the pocket floor, were 
      compared in the biopsy specimens taken from different locations in each group. 
      RESULTS: A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with 
      partial expander deflation. Overall, histopathologic exam revealed aggravated 
      findings of chronic radiodermatitis (epidermal atrophy, dermal inflammation and 
      fibrosis, neovascularisation and vascular changes as well as increased capsule 
      thickness) especially around the lower expander pole, in Group II. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Expander deflation immediately prior to radiotherapy, may augment the adverse 
      effects, especially in the lower expander pole, possibly via enhanced 
      radiosensitization due to a relative increase in the blood flow and tissue 
      oxygenation.

TI  - Does the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predict risk in a 
      subsequent pregnancy?

LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2015.07.029 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether risk of recurrent 
      preterm birth differs based on the clinical presentation of a prior spontaneous 
      preterm birth (SPTB): advanced cervical dilatation (ACD), preterm premature 
      rupture of membranes (PPROM), or preterm labor (PTL). STUDY DESIGN: This 
      retrospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies from 2009 to 2014 
      complicated by a history of prior SPTB. Women were categorized based on the 
      clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or 
      PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared 
      between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. 
      Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: Of 522 
      patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior 
      PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients 
      with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL 
      (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for 
      those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM 
      (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length 
      prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of 
      advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations. 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having 
      recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy 
      compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the use and delivery of cough and cold medicines in 
      children younger than 6 presenting to an inner-city pediatric emergency 
      department (PED) following 2007 FDA warnings. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      observational study was performed using a convenience sampling of PED patients 
      during the fall of 2010. Caregivers were presented with 6 commonly used cough 
      medicine preparations and were asked to demonstrate if and how they would 
      administer these to their children. RESULTS: In all, 65 patients and their 
      caregivers consented and participated in the study. During the demonstration, 82% 
      (53/65) stated that they would treat with cough or cold medicines, and 72% 
      (38/53) incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in 
      children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report 
      that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and 
      interactions with other medications.

TI  - Does occupational nuclear power plant radiation affect conception and pregnancy?
PG  - 130-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of occupational exposure in a nuclear power 
      plant in Griefswald, Germany on male and female fecundity. METHODS: The frequency 
      of men and women exposed to ionizing radiation through work in a nuclear power 
      plant among 270 infertile couples was retrospectively compared to a control 
      fertile population using a pair-matched analysis. The total cumulative equivalent 
      radiation dose was determined. In addition, the spermiograms of the male partners 
      in both groups were compared and correlated to the degree of exposure. RESULTS: 
      No differences were noted in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure 
      between sterile and fertile groups. There was a higher rate of anomalous 
      spermiograms in nuclear power plant workers. However, abnormalities were 
      temporary. No correlation was found between the cumulative equivalent radiation 
      dose and abnormal spermiograms. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that occupational 
      exposure due to ionizing radiation should be investigated as a possible cause for 
      involuntary temporary sterility and as a risk factor for early pregnancy 
      disorders.

TI  - Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus 
      from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or 
      transient ischemic attack?

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting with transient ischemic attack or 
      stroke may have symptom-related lesions on acute computed tomography angiography 
      (CTA) such as free-floating intraluminal thrombus (FFT). It is difficult to 
      distinguish FFT from carotid plaque, but the distinction is critical as 
      management differs. By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions ("virtual 
      endarterectomy"), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective 
      of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately 
      differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 +/- 
      10 years; 10 women, 65.5 +/- 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were 
      defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus 
      false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted 
      from CTA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most 
      discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic 
      (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average 
      classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation. RESULTS: Follow-up 
      imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors 
      delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from 
      combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a 
      specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 +/- 0.09. Average 
      accuracy for each classifier ranged from 65.2%-76.4%. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 
      five quantitative shape descriptors of carotid FFT. This shape "signature" shows 
      potential for supplementing conventional lesion characterization in cases of 
      suspected FFT.

TI  - Can pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages address smoking-related health 
      disparities? Field experiments in Mexico to assess pictorial warning label 
      content.
PG  - 69-80
LID - 10.1007/s10552-012-9899-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the most effective 
      content of pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) and whether educational 
      attainment moderates these effects. METHODS: Field experiments were conducted 
      with 529 adult smokers and 530 young adults (258 nonsmokers; 271 smokers). 
      Participants reported responses to different pictorial HWLs printed on cigarette 
      packages. One experiment involved manipulating textual form (testimonial 
      narrative vs. didactic) and the other involved manipulating image type (diseased 
      organs vs. human suffering). RESULTS: Tests of mean ratings and rankings 
      indicated that pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms had equivalent or 
      significantly higher credibility, relevance, and impact than pictorial HWLs with 
      testimonial forms. Results from mixed-effects models confirmed these results. 
      However, responses differed by participant educational attainment: didactic forms 
      were consistently rated higher than testimonials among participants with higher 
      education, whereas the difference between didactic and testimonial narrative 
      forms was weaker or not statistically significant among participants with lower 
      education. In the second experiment, with textual content held constant, greater 
      credibility, relevance, and impact was found for graphic imagery of diseased 
      organs than imagery of human suffering. CONCLUSIONS: Pictorial HWLs with didactic 
      textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future 
      research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world 
      impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL 
      content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments 
      strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.

TI  - Surgical treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis in patients with double 
      prostheses: is single-valve replacement safe?
PG  - 159-62
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2009.06.019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bias against operating on patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis 
      (PVE) who have multiple prostheses may preclude the use of life-saving valve 
      replacement. We investigated the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of PVE in 
      patients with both mitral and aortic prosthesis and the safety of single-valve 
      replacement when only one valve seemed infected. METHODS: Patients with a 
      diagnosis of active PVE who had mitral and aortic prosthesis in place were 
      assessed. We looked at the methods for diagnosis, causative agents, indication 
      for valve replacement, operative findings and outcome. RESULTS: Twenty patients, 
      who had both mitral and aortic prostheses and a diagnosis of PVE, were assessed. 
      Streptococci and staphylococci caused 70% of cases. By means of echocardiography, 
      the valves involved were: mitral (11 patients), aortic (six patients), and in 
      three cases both prosthetic valves seemed infected. Surgery was undertaken in 17 
      patients (85%). The positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram 
      (TEE) for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection was 100%. In 13 
      patients, only the prosthetic valve that seemed infected was replaced. Four of 
      these patients died within a week after the procedure. Nine patients survived the 
      surgical procedure, completed a course of antimicrobial therapy and were followed 
      up for 15.78 months (95% CI: 12.83-18.72). All were considered cured and relapses 
      were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that 
      did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This 
      fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding 
      the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe 
      strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.

TI  - Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of 
      predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR? A report 
      from the SEARCH database group.
PG  - 53-8
LID - S0090-4295(13)00172-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.urology.2012.10.090 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of various postoperative nomograms to predict 
      prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and to validate that they could predict 
      aggressive biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), grade, 
      and stage are the classic triad used to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy 
      (RP). Multiple nomograms use these to predict risk of BCR. A previous study 
      showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific 
      antigen doubling time [PSADT] <9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it 
      remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM. 
      METHODS: We performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative 
      nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative 
      nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for 
      Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic 
      Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in 
      the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent 
      RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and 
      aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to 
      determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes. RESULTS: We 
      found that each nomogram could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM in a statistically 
      significant manner and that they all predicted PCSM more accurately than they 
      predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values). CONCLUSION: Currently available 
      nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict PCSM and other more clinically 
      relevant endpoints. Moreover, not only do they significantly predict PCSM, but do 
      so with generally greater accuracy than BCR.

TI  - Do "America's Best Hospitals" perform better for acute myocardial infarction?
PG  - 286-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: "America's Best Hospitals," an influential list published annually by 
      U.S. News and World Report, assesses the quality of hospitals. It is not known 
      whether patients admitted to hospitals ranked at the top in cardiology have lower 
      short-term mortality from acute myocardial infarction than those admitted to 
      other hospitals or whether differences in mortality are explained by differential 
      use of recommended therapies. METHODS: Using data from the Cooperative 
      Cardiovascular Project on 149,177 elderly Medicare beneficiaries with acute 
      myocardial infarction in 1994 or 1995, we examined the care and outcomes of 
      patients admitted to three types of hospitals: those ranked high in cardiology 
      (top-ranked hospitals); hospitals not in the top rank that had on-site facilities 
      for cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty, and bypass surgery (similarly 
      equipped hospitals); and the remaining hospitals (non-similarly equipped 
      hospitals). We compared 30-day mortality; the rates of use of aspirin, 
      beta-blockers, and reperfusion; and the relation of differences in rates of 
      therapy to short-term mortality. RESULTS: Admission to a top-ranked hospital was 
      associated with lower adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.87; 95 percent 
      confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.00; P=0.05 for top-ranked hospitals vs. the 
      others). Among patients without contraindications to therapy, top-ranked 
      hospitals had significantly higher rates of use of aspirin (96.2 percent, as 
      compared with 88.6 percent for similarly equipped hospitals and 83.4 percent for 
      non-similarly equipped hospitals; P<0.01) and beta-blockers (75.0 percent vs. 
      61.8 percent and 58.7 percent, P<0.01), but lower rates of reperfusion therapy 
      (61.0 percent vs. 70.7 percent and 65.6 percent, P=0.03). The survival advantage 
      associated with admission to top-ranked hospitals was less strong after we 
      adjusted for factors including the use of aspirin and beta-blockers (odds ratio, 
      0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.08; P=0.38). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Admission to a hospital ranked high on the list of "America's Best Hospitals" was 
      associated with lower 30-day mortality among elderly patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction. A substantial portion of the survival advantage may be 
      associated with these hospitals' higher rates of use of aspirin and beta-blocker 
      therapy.

TI  - Do socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement? 25 year 
      follow up of civil servants from the first Whitehall study.
PG  - 1177-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of death associated with work based and non-work 
      based measures of socioeconomic status before and after retirement age. DESIGN: 
      Follow up study of mortality in relation to employment grade and car ownership 
      over 25 years. SETTING: The first Whitehall study. SUBJECTS: 18,133 male civil 
      servants aged 40-69 years who attended a screening examination between 1967 and 
      1970. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death. RESULTS: Grade of employment was a strong 
      predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest 
      employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% 
      confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict 
      mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of 
      socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than 
      employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined 
      less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to 
      the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car 
      ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal 
      magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the 
      lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person 
      years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic 
      differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase 
      with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status 
      measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on 
      a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work 
      itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in 
      men of working age.

TI  - Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further?
PG  - 334-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The prevalence of retinal haemorrhages after convulsions is 
      not well established. As these haemorrhages are considered characteristic of 
      child abuse, we investigated their occurrence after convulsive episodes to see 
      whether the finding of haemorrhage should prompt further investigation. METHODS: 
      Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the 
      emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and 
      physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. 
      If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out 
      systemic disorder or child abuse. RESULTS: One child was found with unilateral 
      retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A 
      thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding. CONCLUSION: 
      Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding 
      should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.

TI  - Is the use of cyanoacrylate in intestinal anastomosis a good and reliable 
      alternative?
PG  - 581-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2008.08.033 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The present study aims to compare strength, healing, and operation time 
      of experimental intestinal anastomoses performed by polyglactin 910 (Vicryl; 
      Ethicon, Edinburgh, United Kingdom) sutures with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue 
      (Pattex; Henkel, Dusseldorf, Germany). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-six 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 (groups E and L). Each group was further 
      subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, 
      LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by 
      polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B 
      subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and 
      B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was 
      recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were 
      determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same 
      measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of 
      variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were 
      analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than 
      .05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of 
      subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT 
      were significantly better in B subgroups. CONCLUSION: Better healing, shorter AT, 
      and equal strength were achieved with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate compared with 
      polyglactin 910 sutures in intestinal anastomosis in the experimental setting.

TI  - Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of 
      vascular abnormalities in young obese males?
PG  - 335-40
LID - 10.1002/jcu.21927 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To provide insight into the factors by which obesity in itself may 
      directly lead to early arterial damage, we aimed to determine early sonographic 
      markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males. METHODS: 
      Thirty-five young obese males and 23 age-matched healthy male volunteers were 
      recruited into the study. Common carotid artery pulsatility index and resistance 
      index were calculated from blood flow velocities curves obtained by pulsed 
      Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean pulsatility index, resistance index, 
      body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
      homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, plasma fasting glucose, 
      insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were statistically higher in obese subjects 
      than in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that depressed vessel 
      compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, 
      normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk 
      factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese 
      subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early 
      intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular 
      functions.

      patients?
PG  - 361-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ijporl.2007.11.011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether post-operative administration of topical 
      ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: University 
      referral center; ENT Department. PARTICIPANTS: Fourty one children, aged 4-16 
      years, undergoing tonsillectomy. METHODS: Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine 
      hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control 
      group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the 
      two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired 
      Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two 
      independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni 
      correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: Only 
      first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine 
      group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance 
      between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such 
      as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not 
      statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications 
      associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered 
      systemic side effects related to the use of this medication. CONCLUSION: Locally 
      1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric 
      tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of 
      ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective 
      to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.

TI  - Is robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy less invasive than 
      retropubic radical prostatectomy? Results from a prospective, unrandomized, 
      comparative study.
PG  - 1145-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.07513.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy 
      (RALP) is less invasive than radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), as 
      experimental studies suggest that the acute phase reaction is proportional to 
      surgery-induced tissue damage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May and November 
      2006, all patients undergoing RRP or RALP in our department were prospectively 
      assessed. Blood samples were collected 24 h before (T0), during surgery (T1), at 
      the end of anaesthesia (T2), and 12 (T3) and 24 h after surgery (T4), and assayed 
      for interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-1 alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate. The 
      Mann-Whitney U-, Student's t- and Friedman tests were used to compare continuous 
      variables, and the Pearson chi-square and Fisher test for categorical variables, 
      with a two-sided P < 0.05 considered to indicate significance. RESULTS: In all, 
      35 and 26 patients were assessed for RALP and RRP, respectively; the median 
      (interquartile range) age was 62 (56-68) and 68.5 (59.2-71.2) years, respectively 
      (P < 0.009). Baseline levels (T0) of IL-1, IL-6, CRP and lactate were comparable 
      in both arms. IL-6, CRP and lactates levels increased during both kinds of 
      surgery. The mean IL-6 and CPR values were higher for RRP at T1 (P = 0.01 and 
      0.001), T2 (P = 0.001 and <0.001), T3 (P = 0.002 and <0.001) and T4 (P < 0.001 
      and 0.02), respectively. Lactate was higher for RRP at T2 (P = 0.001), T3 (P = 
      0.001) and T4 (P = 0.004), although remaining within the normal ranges. IL-1 
      alpha did not change at the different sample times. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.

TI  - Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive 
      heart failure?
PG  - 300-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementation of the complex treatment strategies that have been 
      shown to improve survival of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) may 
      require certain expertise. We wanted to examine the association between pattern 
      of outpatient care and survival of patients with CHF. METHODS: In a retrospective 
      cohort study conducted with national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
      databases, we examined the association between the pattern of outpatient care and 
      survival in 11,661 patients discharged from VA hospitals between October 1, 1991, 
      and September 30, 1992, with the primary diagnosis of CHF (cohort 1). Patients 
      were divided into 4 groups, on the basis of their pattern of outpatient care over 
      a 12-month period after discharge: 1) general medicine clinic visits only 
      (GM-only); 2) cardiology clinic visits only (CARD-only); 3) general medicine and 
      cardiology (MIXED) clinic visits; and 4) neither general medicine nor cardiology 
      clinic visits (no-GM/CARD). We used the Cox proportional hazards model to 
      evaluate 1-year survival, controlling for clinical and demographic factors. 
      Consistency of our results was examined by performing identical analysis on a 
      cohort of patients discharged from VHA hospitals between October 1, 1994, and 
      September 30, 1995 (cohort 2, n = 10,141). RESULTS: The overall 1-year mortality 
      rate was 23% in the primary cohort. The unadjusted mortality rate was highest for 
      patients in the no-GM/CARD follow up (29%) and lowest for patients in the MIXED 
      group (19%). By use of the MIXED group as reference and adjusting for important 
      clinical and demographic factors, the risk of death (risk ratio [95% CI]) was 
      1.12 (0.94-1.34) in the CARD-only group, 1.26 (1.15-1.38) in the GM-only group, 
      and 1.48 (1.28-1.72) in the no-GM/CARD group. Cohort-2 results were consistent 
      with cohort 1 for most covariates, and significant survival differences were 
      again found between GM-only and the MIXED group (1.25 [1.14-1.37]). CONCLUSIONS: 
      We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of 
      general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner 
      care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival 
      of patients with CHF.

TI  - Histologic evaluation of the testicular remnant associated with the vanishing 
      testes syndrome: is surgical management necessary?
PG  - 1204-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is controversy surrounding the optimal management of the 
      testicular remnant associated with the vanishing testes syndrome. Some urologists 
      advocate the need for surgical exploration, whereas others believe this is 
      unnecessary. These differing opinions are based on the variable reports of viable 
      germ cell elements found within the testicular remnants. To better understand the 
      pathology associated with this syndrome and the need for surgical management, we 
      reviewed our experience regarding the incidence of viable germ cell elements 
      within the testicular remnant. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved, 
      retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients undergoing 
      exploration for a nonpalpable testis at Eastern Virginia Medical School and 
      Geisinger Medical Center between 1994 and 2006. Patients who were found to have 
      spermatic vessels and a vas deferens exiting a closed internal inguinal ring were 
      included in this analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients underwent removal of the 
      testicular remnant. Patient age ranged from 11 to 216 months. In 8 of the 
      specimens (14%), we identified viable germ cell elements. In an additional 4 
      patients (7%), we identified seminiferous tubules without germ cell elements. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our review, we identified that a significant number of testicular 
      remnants associated with the vanishing testes syndrome can harbor viable germ 
      cell elements or seminiferous tubules. The exact fate of these residual elements 
      remains unknown; however, there may exist the potential for malignant 
      transformation. Given the potential for malignant degeneration, we believe that 
      these remnants should be removed.

TI  - Does oxybutynin hydrochloride cause arrhythmia in children with bladder 
      dysfunction?
PG  - 202-4
AB  - AIM: Pediatric surgeons frequently encounter children presenting with voiding 
      dysfunction symptoms, including urgency, frequency, and incontinence. 
      Antimuscarinic agents Oxybutynin) are the main drugs used to treat patients with 
      overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, defined as urgency, with or without urgency 
      incontinence, usually with increased daytime frequency and nocturia. Increased QT 
      dispersion is known to be the cause of ventricular arrhythmia in various systemic 
      diseases and leads to increased mortality and morbidity. METHOD: This study 
      represents a subset of a complete data set, considering only those children aged 
      admitted to the Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Nephrology Clinics during the 
      period January 2011 to July 2012. RESULT: In this study, we have determined that 
      the QT interval changes significantly depending on the use of oxybutynin. The QT 
      changes increased cardiac arrhythmia in children. CONCLUSION: For this reason, 
      children using such drugs should be closely monitored for cardiac arrhythmia.

TI  - Does the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder patients run true 
      over time?
PG  - 1324-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether the manic/mixed episode 
      distinction in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time. METHOD: Over 
      an 11-year period, the observed distribution of manic and mixed episodes 
      (N=1,224) for patients with three or more entries in the management information 
      system of a community mental health center (N=241) was compared to the expected 
      distribution determined by averaging 1,000 randomly generated simulations. 
      RESULTS: Episodes were consistent (all manic or all mixed) in significantly more 
      patients than would be expected by chance. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a 
      pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in 
      patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are 
      needed.

TI  - Is the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected 
      preeclampsia a prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcome? A 
      retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 580-588
LID - 10.1111/aogs.13123 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of the 
      first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) for adverse maternal and neonatal 
      outcomes and how it relates to other prognostic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective cohort study from December 2009 to February 2012 with 
      analysis of demographic, clinical and biochemical data from two obstetric day 
      assessment units in hospitals in Southeast Scotland. We included 717 pregnant 
      women, with singleton pregnancies after 20 weeks' gestation, referred for 
      evaluation of suspected preeclampsia and having their first ACR performed. The 
      ability of ACR to predict future outcomes was assessed in both univariable and 
      multivariable logistic regression models. The latter assessed its prognostic 
      value independent of (adjusting for) existing prognostic factors. Primary outcome 
      measures were maternal and neonatal composite adverse outcomes, and a secondary 
      outcome was gestation at delivery. RESULTS: In all, 204 women (28.5%) experienced 
      a composite adverse maternal outcome and 146 women (20.4%) experienced a 
      composite adverse neonatal outcome. Multivariate analysis of log-transformed ACR 
      demonstrated that a 1-unit increase in log ACR is associated with an increased 
      odds of adverse maternal [odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      1.45-1.80] and adverse neonatal (odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29) composite 
      outcomes, and with reduced gestational age at delivery (coefficient: -0.46, 95% 
      CI -0.54 to -0.38). CONCLUSIONS: ACR is an independent prognostic factor for 
      maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be 
      useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.

TI  - Are pediatric concussion patients compliant with discharge instructions?
PG  - 117-22; discussion 122
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000000275 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concussions are commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting 
      to the emergency department (ED). The primary objective of this study was to 
      evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management. 
      METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 
      2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 
      pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were 
      discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria 
      included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, 
      intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or 
      preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in 
      the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the 
      treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 
      weeks after ED visit. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. The 
      majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related 
      concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) 
      injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play 
      (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and 
      nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion 
      patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 
      0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p < 0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal 
      activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most 
      (58%) did not receive medical clearance. Of the patients who had returned to 
      activities at 4 weeks (64%), less than one quarter (23%) were symptomatic, and 
      most (54%) received medical clearance. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients discharged 
      from the ED are mostly compliant with concussion instructions. However, a 
      significant number of patients RTP on the day of injury, while experiencing 
      symptoms or without medical clearance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Care management, level 
      IV. Epidemiologic study, level III.

TI  - [Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught? Evaluation of a course 
      model].
PG  - 477-83
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Communication with terminally ill patients is a main 
      responsibility of physicians. However, many physicians feel insufficiently 
      prepared for this task. Models of courses resulting in improvements of 
      communicative skills of participants have been published mainly in the 
      Anglo-American literature. This study describes the realization of a 2-day course 
      model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in 
      Rhineland-Palatinate, and analyzes changes of participants' communication 
      behavior. METHODS: After each seminary, an evaluation form concerning 
      participants' satisfaction with the course was filled in. Furthermore, all course 
      participants received a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the 
      course, as well as 3 months afterwards. The participants were asked to assess 
      their own sense of security in seven different communication settings on a visual 
      analog scale, and to specify perceived changes in their communication behavior 3 
      months after the course. RESULTS: The first three courses were attended by 31 
      participants. Course evaluation revealed high satisfaction scores with methods as 
      well as with clarity and relevance of the contents. Self-assessment of 
      participants showed a growing sense of security in different communication 
      settings. Important increases could be demonstrated for communicating a diagnosis 
      of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer or a far 
      progressive cancer disease without curative approach. 3 months after the course, 
      participants described multiple changes indicating increased sensibility and 
      professionalism in communication behavior. CONCLUSION: The realized communication 
      skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and 
      self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can 
      be taught.

TI  - Are environmental factors important in primary systemic vasculitis? A 
      case-control study.
PG  - 814-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between primary systemic vasculitis 
      (PSV) and environmental risk factors. METHODS: Seventy-five PSV cases and 273 
      controls (220 nonvasculitis, 19 secondary vasculitis, and 34 asthma controls) 
      were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Factors investigated were 
      social class, occupational and residential history, smoking, pets, allergies, 
      vaccinations, medications, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and farm exposure in the year 
      before symptom onset (index year). The Standard Occupational Classification 2000 
      and job-exposure matrices were used to assess occupational silica, solvent, and 
      metal exposure. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the 
      odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for potential 
      confounders. Total PSV, subgroups (47 Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], 12 
      microscopic polyangiitis, 16 Churg-Strauss syndrome [CSS]), and antineutrophil 
      cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive cases were compared with control groups. 
      RESULTS: Farming in the index year was significantly associated with PSV (OR 2.3 
      [95% CI 1.2-4.6]), with WG (2.7 [1.2-5.8]), with MPA (6.3 [1.9-21.6]), and with 
      perinuclear ANCA (pANCA) (4.3 [1.5-12.7]). Farming during working lifetime was 
      associated with PSV (2.2 [1.2-3.8]) and with WG (2.7 [1.3-5.7]). Significant 
      associations were found for high occupational silica exposure in the index year 
      (with PSV 3.0 [1.0-8.4], with CSS 5.6 [1.3-23.5], and with ANCA 4.9 [1.3-18.6]), 
      high occupational solvent exposure in the index year (with PSV 3.4 [0.9-12.5], 
      with WG 4.8 [1.2-19.8], and with classic ANCA [cANCA] 3.9 [1.6-9.5]), high 
      occupational solvent exposure during working lifetime (with PSV 2.7 [1.1-6.6], 
      with WG 3.4 [1.3-8.9], and with cANCA 3.3 [1.0-10.8]), drug allergy (with PSV 3.6 
      [1.8-7.0], with WG 4.0 [1.8-8.7], and with cANCA 4.7 [1.9-11.7]), and allergy 
      overall (with PSV 2.2 [1.2-3.9], with WG 2.7 [1.4-5.7]). No other significant 
      associations were found. CONCLUSION: A significant association between farming 
      and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously 
      reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.

TI  - Diagnosis and follow-up in constipated children: should we use ultrasound?
PG  - 1849-55
LID - 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2010.05.006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the efficacy of ultrasound in determining megarectum and 
      fecal load and the response to treatment in constipation and tried to specify 
      objective criteria in this study. METHODS: A total of 66 cases were queried and 
      divided into 2 groups as constipated (n = 35; mean age, 6.8 +/- 2.9 years) and 
      control (n = 31; mean age, 8.4 +/- 3.8 years) according to Rome III criteria. After 
      the clinical evaluation, pelvic ultrasonography (US) was performed by 2 separate 
      radiologists. The bladder capacity and the transverse rectal diameter were 
      measured with a full bladder. Then the rectal diameter and rectal anterior wall 
      thickness were measured, and the presence of fecal load in the rectum and sigmoid 
      colon was recorded with an empty bladder. The examination and ultrasound were 
      repeated after treatment for a month in these patients. RESULTS: Comparison of 
      the US measurements of the 2 radiologists performing the US tests did not show 
      any interobserver difference (r = 0.981; P < .001). We therefore believe our 
      results are objective and reproducible. We found a positive correlation between 
      the rectal diameters and the age, height, weight, and bladder capacity. The 
      posturination mean rectal diameter was thicker in the constipated group (3.02 +/- 
      1.04 cm) than in the control group (1.98 +/- 0.64 cm) (P < .001). The cutoff point 
      of rectal diameter for a diagnosis of constipation was determined as 2.44 cm (71% 
      sensitive; 76% specific; area under curve, 0.825; P < .001). The rectal anterior 
      wall thickness and fecal load were higher in the constipated patients (P < .001). 
      There was a significant decrease in the constipation score and fecal load after 
      treatment for a month (P < .001), but the rectal diameter had not reached normal 
      limits yet despite the decrease (2.71 +/- 0.77 cm) (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The use 
      of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective 
      criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs 
      to be continued.

TI  - Out of the smokescreen II: will an advertisement targeting the tobacco industry 
      affect young people's perception of smoking in movies and their intention to 
      smoke?
PG  - 177-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an antismoking advertisement on young 
      people's perceptions of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke. 
      SUBJECTS/SETTING: 3091 cinema patrons aged 12-24 years in three Australian 
      states; 18.6% of the sample (n = 575) were current smokers. DESIGN/INTERVENTION: 
      Quasi-experimental study of patrons, surveyed after having viewed a movie. The 
      control group was surveyed in week 1, and the intervention group in weeks 2 and 
      3. Before seeing the movie in weeks 2 and 3, a 30 s antismoking advertisement was 
      shown, shot in the style of a movie trailer that warned patrons not to be sucked 
      in by the smoking in the movie they were about to see. OUTCOMES: Attitude of 
      current smokers and non-smokers to smoking in the movies; intention of current 
      smokers and non-smokers to smoke in 12 months. RESULTS: Among non-smokers, 47.8% 
      of the intervention subjects thought that the smoking in the viewed movie was not 
      OK compared with 43.8% of the control subjects (p = 0.04). However, there was no 
      significant difference among smokers in the intervention (16.5%) and control 
      (14.5%) groups (p = 0.4). A higher percentage of smokers in the intervention 
      group indicated that they were likely to be smoking in 12 months time (38.6%) 
      than smokers in the control group (25.6%; p<0.001). For non-smokers, there was no 
      significant difference in smoking intentions between groups, with 1.2% of 
      intervention subjects and 1.6% of controls saying that they would probably be 
      smoking in 12 months time (p = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study suggests 
      that placing an antismoking advertisement before movies containing smoking scenes 
      can help to immunise non-smokers against the influences of film stars' smoking. 
      Caution must be exercised in the type of advertisement screened as some types of 
      advertising may reinforce smokers' intentions to smoke.

TI  - Do general practitioner hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital 
      beds? Evidence from Finnmark county in north Norway.
PG  - 243-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess whether populations with access to general 
      practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals) utilise general hospitals less than 
      populations without such access. DESIGN: Observational study comparing the total 
      rates of admissions and of occupied bed days in general hospitals between 
      populations with and without access to GP hospitals. Comparisons were also made 
      separately for diagnoses commonly encountered in GP hospitals. SETTING: Two 
      general hospitals serving the population of Finnmark county in north Norway. 
      PATIENTS: 35,435 admissions based on five years' routine recordings from the two 
      hospitals. MAIN RESULTS: The total rate of admission to general hospitals was 
      lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital than in central 
      municipalities without this kind of institution, 26% and 28% lower for men and 
      women respectively. The corresponding differences were 38% and 52%, when analysed 
      for occupied bed days. The differences were most pronounced for patients with 
      respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, and cancer who are primarily or 
      intermediately treated or cared for in GP hospitals, and for patients with stroke 
      and fractures, who are regularly transferred from general hospitals to GP 
      hospitals for longer term follow up care. CONCLUSION: GP hospitals seem to reduce 
      the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as 
      occupied bed days.

TI  - Does insulin resistance drive the association between hyperglycemia and 
      cardiovascular risk?
PG  - e39260
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0039260 [doi]
LID - e39260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown associations between hyperglycemia and 
      risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, yet glucose-lowering 
      treatment does little to mitigate this risk. We examined whether associations 
      between hyperglycemia and CVD risk were explained by underlying insulin 
      resistance. METHODS: In 60 middle-aged individuals without diabetes we studied 
      the associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour post oral glucose tolerance 
      test plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity as well as body fat percentage with CVD 
      risk. Insulin sensitivity was measured as the glucose infusion rate during a 
      euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, body fat percentage was measured by dual X-ray 
      absorptiometry, and CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. 
      Associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin 
      sensitivity and body fat percentage with the Framingham risk score were assessed 
      in linear regression models. RESULTS: Both fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose 
      levels were associated with higher Framingham risk score (fasting glucose: r(2) = 
      0.21; 2-hour glucose: r(2) = 0.24; P<0.001 for both), and insulin sensitivity 
      with lower Framingham risk score (r(2) = 0.36; P<0.001). However, adjustment for 
      insulin sensitivity and 2-hour glucose made the effect of fasting glucose 
      non-significant (P = 0.060). Likewise, when adjusting for insulin sensitivity and 
      fasting glucose, the association between 2-hour glucose and Framingham risk score 
      disappeared (P = 0.143). In contrast, insulin sensitivity was still associated 
      with Framingham risk score after adjusting for glucose levels (P<0.001). Body fat 
      was not associated with Framingham risk score when taking insulin sensitivity 
      into account (P = 0.550). CONCLUSION: The association between plasma glucose 
      levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the 
      question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that 
      underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes or its prevention.

TI  - Ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria: are there different levels of risk 
      for transition to psychosis?
PG  - 62-8
LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2010.10.017 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria have been 
      validated in a number of studies. However, it is not known whether particular UHR 
      criteria (Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms (APS), Brief Limited Intermittent 
      Psychotic Symptoms (BLIPS) or Trait vulnerability criteria), or combination of 
      criteria, is associated with a higher risk of transition to psychosis. The 
      current study investigated this issue over a 6-month follow-up period. We 
      hypothesised that the risk of transition would increase in the following order: 
      Trait alone<APS alone < APS+Trait<BLIPS. METHOD: Data on UHR intake criteria and 
      transition to psychosis status at 6 months were analysed for UHR patients seen at 
      the PACE clinic, Orygen Youth Health between January 2000 and November 2008. 
      RESULTS: A total of 928 new referrals were accepted into the PACE clinic over 
      this period of whom 817 (88%) had baseline information available for analysis. 
      The percentage of subjects who presented with APS, Trait and BLIPS were 83%, 27% 
      and 4%, respectively. When the two intermediate groups (APS alone and APS+Trait) 
      were combined, there was evidence that the risk of transition increased in the 
      order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS (p=0.024, adjusted analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      data suggest that UHR intake criteria predict transition over 6 months in the 
      order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS. The fact that BLIPS patients are at the highest 
      risk of transition over the short term is consistent with the "early" versus 
      "late" prodrome model. It also indicates that particular clinical attention may 
      need to be paid to BLIPS patients, especially early in the course of treatment.

TI  - Aberrant loss of dickkopf-3 in gastric cancer: can it predict lymph node 
      metastasis preoperatively?
PG  - 1018-25
LID - 10.1007/s00268-014-2886-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) may act as a tumor suppressor as it is 
      down-regulated in various types of cancer. This study assessed the DKK3 protein 
      expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker. 
      METHODS: DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric 
      cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. 
      Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. RESULTS: Loss of 
      DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated 
      with advanced T stage (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), UICC TNM 
      stage (p < 0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 
      0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in 
      tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than 
      those with DKK3 expression (p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p 
      = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, 
      respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. 
      Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), 
      loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in 
      patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The 
      combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging 
      for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. 
      CONCLUSION: Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with 
      poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with 
      the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that 
      can improve the predictive power of CT.

TI  - Can CT predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus?
PG  - 183-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in children with tuberculous 
      meningitis (TBM) depends on the level of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) block. 
      Air-encephalography is regarded as the gold standard for differentiating 
      communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus. Since air-encephalography 
      involves a lumbar puncture, it carries the risk of cerebral herniation. AIM. The 
      aim of this study was to determine whether communicating and non-communicating 
      hydrocephalus in TBM can be differentiated by means of cranial computerised 
      tomography (CT). METHODS: A number of CT indices were measured in 50 children 
      with communicating and 34 children with non-communicating hydrocephalus according 
      to air-encephalographic findings. RESULTS: The only CT finding that correlated 
      with the type of hydrocephalus was the shape of the third ventricle. 
      Significantly more children with non-communicating hydrocephalus had a rounded 
      third ventricle than those with communicating hydrocephalus. CONCLUSION: CT is 
      therefore not useful in determining the level of CSF block in TBM. 
      Air-encephalography remains the most reliable way of determining the level of CSF 
      obstruction.

TI  - Is oral endotracheal intubation efficacy impaired in the helicopter environment?
PG  - 319-21
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients transported by helicopter often require advanced airway 
      management. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not the 
      in-flight environment of air medical transport in a BO-105 helicopter impairs the 
      ability of flight nurses to perform oral endotracheal intubation. SETTING: The 
      study was conducted in an MBB BO-105 helicopter. METHODS: Flight nurses performed 
      three manikin intubations in each of the two study environments: on an emergency 
      department stretcher and in-flight in the BO-105 helicopter. RESULTS: The mean 
      time required for in-flight intubation (25.9 +/- 10.9 seconds) was significantly 
      longer than the corresponding time (13.2 +/- 2.8 seconds) required for intubation 
      in the control setting (ANOVA, F = 38.7, p < .001). All intubations performed in 
      the control setting were placed correctly in the trachea; there were two (6.7%) 
      esophageal intubations in the in-flight setting. The difference in appropriate 
      endotracheal intubation between the two settings was not significant (chi 2 = 
      0.3; p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting 
      of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a 
      ground setting. The results support pre-flight intubation of patients who appear 
      likely to require urgent intubation during air medical transport in the BO-105 
      helicopter.

TI  - Sternal plating for primary and secondary sternal closure; can it improve sternal 
      stability?
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/1749-8090-4-19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sternal instability with mediastinitis is a very serious complication 
      after median sternotomy. Biomechanical studies have suggested superiority of 
      rigid plate fixation over wire cerclage for sternal fixation. This study tests 
      the hypothesis that sternal closure stability can be improved by adding plate 
      fixation in a human cadaver model. METHODS: Midline sternotomy was performed in 
      18 human cadavers. Four sternal closure techniques were tested: (1) approximation 
      with six interrupted steel wires; (2) approximation with six interrupted cables; 
      (3) closure 1 (wires) or 2 (cables) reinforced with a transverse sternal plate at 
      the sixth rib; (4) Closure using 4 sternal plates alone. Intrathoracic pressure 
      was increased in all techniques while sternal separation was measured by three 
      pairs of sonomicrometry crystals fixed at the upper, middle and lower parts of 
      the sternum until 2.0 mm separation was detected. Differences in displacement 
      pressures were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Regression 
      Coefficients. RESULTS: Intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm separation 
      increased significantly from 183.3 +/- 123.9 to 301.4 +/- 204.5 in wires/cables 
      alone vs. wires/cables plus one plate respectively, and to 355.0 +/- 210.4 in the 
      4 plates group (p < 0.05). Regression Coefficients (95% CI) were 120 (47-194) and 
      142 (66-219) respectively for the plate groups. CONCLUSION: Transverse sternal 
      plating with 1 or 4 plates significantly improves sternal stability closure in 
      human cadaver model. Adding a single sternal plate to primary closure improves 
      the strength of sternal closure with traditional wiring potentially reducing the 
      risk of sternal dehiscence and could be considered in high risk patients.

TI  - Can early second-look tympanoplasty reduce the rate of conversion to modified 
      radical mastoidectomy?
PG  - 590-3
LID - 10.3109/00016489.2012.762116 [doi]
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful 
      treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease 
      comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows 
      easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion 
      rate to open mastoidectomy. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to report the 
      rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary CAT surgery and 
      to report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. METHODS: 
      This was a retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012. 
      RESULTS: In total 132 second-look operations were undertaken, with a mean 
      interval between primary surgery and second-look procedures of 6 months. The rate 
      of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual 
      disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with 
      cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease. Residual disease was defined 
      as cholesteatoma present behind an intact tympanic membrane. The majority of 
      recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (73.1%). Only 
      four cases were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy (3%) and three 
      cases required a third-look procedure.

PG  - 132-4
LID - 10.1159/000258697 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present studywas designed to investigate the possible role of T 
      cells in spatial learning ability in mouse after toluene exposure. METHOD: 
      Eight-week-old male wild-type (WT) and nude mice of BALB/c strain were exposed to 
      toluene (0, 9 and 90 ppm) in a nose-only exposure chamber for 30 min per day for 
      3 consecutive days and then once per week for 4 weeks. Twenty-four hours after 
      the completion of exposure, we examined the spatial learning ability in each 
      mouse using the Morris water maze apparatus. RESULTS: In the acquisition phase, a 
      longer escape latency was observed in nude mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene on days 
      3 and 4 when compared with corresponding WT mice. However, the effect of toluene 
      on the escape latency was not significant in nude mice. In the probe trial, WT 
      mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene showed poor retention memory compared with the 
      control group. In the reversal phase, we did not find any significant difference 
      between groups. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may 
      affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.

TI  - Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older 
      people socially imbalanced?: a cross sectional study in Denmark.
PG  - 396
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-12-396 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventive home visits are offered to community dwelling older people 
      in Denmark aimed at maintaining their functional ability for as long as possible, 
      but only two thirds of older people accept the offer from the municipalities. The 
      purpose of this study is to investigate 1) whether socioeconomic status was 
      associated with acceptance of preventive home visits among older people and 2) 
      whether municipality invitational procedures for the preventive home visits 
      modified the association. METHODS: The study population included 1,023 community 
      dwelling 80-year-old individuals from the Danish intervention study on preventive 
      home visits. Information on preventive home visit acceptance rates was obtained 
      from questionnaires. Socioeconomic status was measured by financial assets 
      obtained from national registry data, and invitational procedures were identified 
      through the municipalities. Logistic regression analyses were used, adjusted by 
      gender. RESULTS: Older persons with high financial assets accepted preventive 
      home visits more frequently than persons with low assets (adjusted OR = 1.5 
      (CI95%: 1.1-2.0)). However, the association was attenuated when adjusted by the 
      invitational procedures. The odds ratio for accepting preventive home visits was 
      larger among persons with low financial assets invited by a letter with a 
      proposed date than among persons with high financial assets invited by other 
      procedures, though these estimates had wide confidence intervals. CONCLUSION: 
      High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of 
      preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational 
      procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of 
      publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more 
      proactive invitational procedures.

TI  - Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the 
      etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?
PG  - 1717-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early 
      posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the 
      ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood 
      of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. 
      Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients 
      who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of 
      neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that 
      enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early 
      postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the 
      etiology of ARDS. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: University 
      Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. 
      Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology. PATIENTS: Adult 
      blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score > or = 18. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major 
      trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later. Identical samples 
      were obtained from normal laboratory volunteers (n = 9). The neutrophil count in 
      each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous 
      tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 
      10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in 
      the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated 
      significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. 
      Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to 
      concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when 
      compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p <.05). Neutrophils 
      isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to 
      high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission, in 
      contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils 
      isolated from normal laboratory volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that 
      major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. 
      This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration 
      in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In 
      patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts 
      decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory 
      activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be 
      central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is 
      characteristic of ARDS.

      predict improvements in child survival? An analysis of serial cross-sectional 
      national surveys.
PG  - 456
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-11-456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are three main service delivery channels: clinical services, 
      outreach, and family and community. To determine which delivery channels are 
      associated with the greatest reductions in under-5 mortality rates (U5MR), we 
      used data from sequential population-based surveys to examine the correlation 
      between changes in coverage of clinical, outreach, and family and community 
      services and in U5MR for 27 high-burden countries. METHODS: Household survey data 
      were abstracted from serial surveys in 27 countries. Average annual changes (AAC) 
      between the most recent and penultimate survey were calculated for under-five 
      mortality rates and for 22 variables in the domains of clinical, outreach, and 
      family- and community-based services. For all 27 countries and a subset of 19 
      African countries, we conducted principal component analysis to reduce the 
      variables into a few components in each domain and applied linear regression to 
      assess the correlation between changes in the principal components and changes in 
      under-five mortality rates after controlling for multiple potential confounding 
      factors. RESULTS: AAC in under 5-mortality varied from 6.6% in Nepal to -0.9% in 
      Kenya, with six of the 19 African countries all experiencing less than a 1% 
      decline in mortality. The strongest correlation with reductions in U5MR was 
      observed for access to clinical services (all countries: p = 0.02, r(2) = 0.58; 19 
      African countries p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.67). For outreach activities, AAC U5MR was 
      significantly correlated with antenatal care and family planning services, while 
      AAC in immunization services showed no association. In the family- and community 
      services domain, improvements in breastfeeding were associated with significant 
      changes in mortality in the 30 countries but not in the African subset; while in 
      the African countries, nutritional status improvements were associated with a 
      significant decline in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the 
      importance of increasing access to clinical services, certain outreach services 
      and breastfeeding and, in Africa, of improving nutritional status. Integrated 
      programs that emphasize these services may lead to substantial mortality 
      declines.

TI  - Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic 
      manifestation of esophagitis in children?
PG  - 485-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We observed an endoscopic abnormally in a group of children with 
      histological esophagitis. We termed this finding "vertical lines in esophageal 
      mucosa" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and 
      significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies. METHODS: Between 
      January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 
      esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and 
      histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic 
      appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a 
      blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies. RESULTS: The esophageal mucosa had 
      a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only 
      mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 
      160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most 
      patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 
      0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p > 0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 
      of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were 
      present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in 
      children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the OraQuick(R) HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure 
      Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) in sputum is a valid tool for HIV 
      surveillance among TB patients. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out 
      on sputa of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sputa were tested for 
      antibodies to HIV using OraQuick(R) HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., 
      Bethlehem, PA, USA). The results were compared with results of serum ELISA. 
      RESULTS: Compared to serum ELISA, the OraQuick(R) HIV-1/2 Assay in sputum specimens 
      reported 90% sensitivity (9/10) and 100% specificity (307/307), with a positive 
      predictive value of 100% (95%CI: 66.37%-100.00%) and a negative predictive value 
      of 99.68% (95%CI: 98.20%-99.99%). CONCLUSIONS: This testing method may provide a 
      useful strategy for conducting HIV surveillance in possible co-infected TB 
      patients at peripheral centres. Since there is no investment on infrastructure, 
      it may be possible for paramedical health professionals to carry out the test, 
      particularly in areas with low HIV endemicity.

TI  - Is crime associated with over-the-counter pharmacy syringe sales? Findings from 
      Los Angeles, California.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 50,000 new HIV infections occur annually in the United 
      States. Injection drug users represent twelve percent of incident HIV infections 
      each year. Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent 
      HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United 
      States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, 
      policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between 
      OTC syringe sales and crime. METHODS: We used a geographic information system and 
      novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of 
      pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between 
      January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting 
      Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation 
      as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling 
      pharmacies. RESULTS: By December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police 
      Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. 
      Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 
      2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts. Using generalized estimating equations and 
      adjusting for potential confounders, reported crime rates were negatively 
      associated with OTC syringe sales (adjusted rate ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence 
      interval: 0.81, 0.99). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that OTC pharmacy 
      syringe sales were not associated with increases in reported crime in local 
      communities in Los Angeles during 2006-2008.

TI  - Colorectal cancer in young patients: is it a distinct clinical entity?
PG  - 684-695
LID - 10.1007/s10147-015-0935-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of colorectal cancer in young patients is increasing. 
      It remains unclear if the disease has unique features in this age group. METHODS: 
      This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study which included patients 
      diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age </=40 years in 1997-2013 matched 1:2 by 
      year of diagnosis with consecutive colorectal cancer patients diagnosed at age 
      >50 years during the same period. Patients aged 41-50 years were not included in 
      the study, to accentuate potential age-related differences. Clinicopathological 
      characteristics, treatment, and outcome were compared between groups. RESULTS: 
      The cohort included 330 patients, followed for a median time of 65.9 months 
      (range 4.7-211). Several significant differences were noted. The younger group 
      had a different ethnic composition. They had higher rates of family history of 
      colorectal cancer (p = 0.003), hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes 
      (p < 0.0001), and inflammatory bowel disease (p = 0.007), and a lower rate of 
      polyps (p < 0.0001). They were more likely to present with stage III or IV 
      disease (p = 0.001), angiolymphatic invasion, signet cell ring adenocarcinoma, 
      and rectal tumors (p = 0.02). Younger patients more frequently received 
      treatment. Young patients had a worse estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate 
      (57.6  vs. 70 %, p = 0.039), but this did not retain significance when analyzed 
      by stage (p = 0.092). Estimated 5-year overall survival rates were 59.1 and 
      62.1 % in the younger and the control group, respectively (p = 0.565). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer among young patients may constitute a distinct 
      clinical entity. Further research is needed to validate our findings and define 
      the optimal approach in this population.

TI  - Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes? An analysis of a natural 
      experiment in a Spanish hospital.
PG  - 1059-65
LID - 10.1111/jep.12460 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, 
      but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when 
      part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to 
      form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended 
      similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity. 
      METHODS: We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two 
      different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP 
      unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor 
      and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to 
      reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in 
      patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit 
      was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods 
      were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: No statistically 
      significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP 
      doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the 
      mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous 
      performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 
      6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP 
      physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or 
      their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients 
      had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) 
      and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. 
      Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended 
      twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors. CONCLUSION: The EBP unit was 
      associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than 
      achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the features of PMR that may predict the duration of 
      steroid therapy, the occurrence of relapses and the late development of GCA. 
      METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 176 patients with PMR, followed up for 5 
      years. Baseline factors associated with the duration of steroids therapy were 
      identified using Cox regression. Predictors of relapse and the late development 
      of GCA were identified using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 176 
      patients with PMR were included, of whom 124 stopped steroids within 5 years. The 
      probability of stopping steroids within 5 years was independently reduced by an 
      elevated plasma viscosity (PV) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.82 for a 
      PV > or = 2.00 mPa s compared with a PV < or = 1.80 mPa s; overall P = 0.024] and 
      by starting treatment at >15 mg prednisolone (HR = 0.63; 95% CI 0.41, 0.97; P = 
      0.036). Either of these independently reduced the chances of stopping steroids 
      within a given time interval between 27 and 51%. No significant predictors of 
      relapse were identified. Predictors of late GCA on univariable analysis were 
      female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 8.16; 95% CI 1.06, 63.13; P = 0.044], HLA-DRB1*0101 
      or -*0401 alleles (OR = 4.95; 95% CI 1.05, 23.34; P = 0.043), PV > or = 2.00 mPa 
      s compared with PV < or = 1.80 mPa s (OR = 10.64; 95% CI 1.28, 88.38; P = 0.029) 
      and initial prednisolone dose >15 mg (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 1.61, 12.79; P = 0.004). 
      CONCLUSION: A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy 
      and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late 
      GCA. Starting patients on >15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged 
      steroid duration.

TI  - Does prior benign prostate biopsy predict outcome for patients treated with 
      radical perineal prostatectomy?
PG  - 332-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prior benign prostate biopsies on the 
      surgical and clinical outcomes of patients treated with radical perineal 
      prostatectomy for prostate cancer. METHODS: A total of 1369 patients with 
      clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single 
      surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had 
      undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising 
      prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted 
      our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented 
      our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month 
      intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific 
      antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. RESULTS: Patients with a prior benign 
      biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% 
      versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 
      patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had 
      eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that 
      patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free 
      survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or 
      greater; P <0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability 
      (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the 
      control group. CONCLUSIONS: A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently 
      associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after 
      prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Is the Distance Worth It? Patients With Rectal Cancer Traveling to High-Volume 
      Centers Experience Improved Outcomes.
PG  - 1250-1259
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000000924 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers 
      would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer 
      resection. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
      operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing 
      the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers 
      versus far, high-volume centers. DESIGN: This was a population-based study. 
      SETTINGS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal 
      cancer. PATIENTS: Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent 
      surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant 
      chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 
      90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 18,605 
      patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the 
      long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. 
      The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group 
      and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, 
      white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a 
      high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital 
      factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a 
      lymph node yield >/=12 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and 
      higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in 
      the long-distance/high-volume group. The short-distance/low-volume group had a 
      34% high risk of overall mortality at 5 years compared with the 
      long-distance/high-volume group. LIMITATIONS: We lacked data regarding patient 
      and physician decision making and surgeon-specific factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results indicate that when controlled for patient, tumor, and hospital factors, 
      patients who traveled a long distance to a high-volume center had improved lymph 
      node yield, neoadjuvant chemoradiation receipt, and 30- and 90-day mortality 
      compared with those who traveled a short distance to a low-volume center. They 
      also had improved 5-year survival. See Video Abstract at

TI  - Treatment as prevention in resource-limited settings: is it feasible to maintain 
      HIV viral load suppression over time?
PG  - 593-9
LID - 10.3855/jidc.2926 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of 
      "treatment as prevention" (TasP). Some of the questions regarding TasP strategies 
      arise from the perceived difficulties in achieving and maintaining viral load 
      (VL) suppression over time and the risk of emergence of viral resistance that 
      could compromise future treatment options. This study was conducted to assess 
      these questions in a resource-limited setting. METHODOLOGY: We performed a 
      retrospective observational study of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the 
      pre-HAART era on follow-up at a private center from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
      Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from clinical 
      charts. Analyses were performed to test for potential associations of selected 
      variables with current virologic failure or use of third-line drugs. RESULTS: Of 
      619 patients on follow-up, 82 (13.2%) were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. At the 
      time of our study, 79 (96.3%) patients were on HAART, with a median duration of 
      14 years (IQR 12-15) of therapy, and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse 
      transcriptase inhibitors regimens in 47.8% of cases. Sixty-nine patients (87.3%) 
      had undetectable VL, 37 (46.8%) never presented virologic failure, and 19 (24.1%) 
      experienced only one failure. Thirteen patients (16.5%) were receiving third-line 
      ART regimens, with an average of 2.7-fold more virologic failures than those on 
      first- or second-line regimens (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining viral load 
      suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.

TI  - Does head positioning influence anterior chamber depth in pseudoexfoliation 
      syndrome?
PG  - 214-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Phacodonesis can occur in pseudoexfoliation syndrome because of impaired 
      zonular support. This study investigates whether the increased mobility of the 
      lens influences anterior chamber depth in patients with pseudoexfoliation while 
      assuming a prone position. METHODS: Central anterior chamber depth was measured 
      in 39 patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation and elevated 
      intraocular pressure. Patients were placed in a face-up position for 5 minutes, 
      at which time anterior chamber depth and axial length were measured by A scan, 
      and intraocular pressure was measured by Tonopen (Oculab, La Jolla, CA) in both 
      eyes. The measurements were repeated on both eyes after 5 minutes in a face-down 
      position. RESULTS: No significant differences in intraocular pressure or axial 
      length between the prone and supine positions were found in either eye. Anterior 
      chamber depth in eyes with pseudoexfoliation decreased from a mean of 3.08 mm in 
      the supine position to a mean of 2.95 mm in the prone position, whereas mean 
      anterior chamber depth in the fellow eyes decreased from 3.01 mm to 2.97 mm. The 
      decrease in anterior chamber depth when facing down in the eyes with 
      pseudoexfoliation was significantly greater than in the fellow eyes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the lens seems 
      to be more mobile in the affected eye. This results in a shallower anterior 
      chamber when the head is placed in a prone position. Whether this fact might 
      potentially lead to transient pupillary block when engaging in activities such as 
      facing down while reading warrants further study.

TI  - Are intraoperative precursor events associated with postoperative major adverse 
      events?
PG  - 1499-504
LID - S0022-5223(13)00581-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.05.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent 
      adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose 
      of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated 
      with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute 
      renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass 
      grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These 
      events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement. METHODS: The 
      present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth 
      Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced 
      postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced 
      postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 
      surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty 
      weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete 
      revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of >/=1 precursor events in 
      the matched groups was performed. RESULTS: A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) 
      were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than 
      in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P = .015). The incidence of the individual 
      events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was 
      significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in 
      the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important 
      postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are 
      exposed to intraoperative precursor events were more likely to experience a 
      postoperative MACE. Quality improvement techniques aimed at mitigating the 
      consequences of precursor events might improve the surgical outcomes for cardiac 
      surgical patients.

TI  - Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the 
      beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes?
PG  - 1346-50
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00888.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a common cause of early 
      respiratory distress in the neonatal period of term infants. Delayed resorption 
      of foetal lung fluid after birth is considered as the main pathophysiological 
      factor. As resorption of foetal lung fluid is a catecholamine dependent process, 
      we aimed at investigating, whether beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1, ADRB2) 
      polymorphisms, known to alter catecholamine activity, are operative in TTN. 
      METHODS: DNA was collected for genotyping from 73 term newborns suffering from 
      TTN and 55 healthy controls from a Caucasian cohort. RESULTS: TTN infants were 
      more likely to be male (70% vs. 49%; p < 0.05), had a lower mean birthweight 
      (3120 +/- 450 vs. 3396 +/- 504 g; p < 0.001) and gestational age (GA) (38.4 +/- 
      1.2 vs. 39.4 +/- 1.3 weeks; p < 0.001) and were more often delivered by caesarean 
      section (CS) (71% vs. 26%; p < 0.001). The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism differed 
      significantly between cases and controls. Multivariate analysis provided 
      beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 
      0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant 
      association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with 
      TTN (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC 
      haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose 
      to TTN.

TI  - Could ADMA levels in young adults born preterm predict an early endothelial 
      dysfunction?
PG  - 217-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.02.069 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sporadic data present in literature report how preterm birth and low 
      birth weight are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases in 
      later life. High levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a strong inhibitor 
      of nitric oxide synthesis, are associated with the future development of adverse 
      cardiovascular events and cardiac death. AIMS: 1) to verify the presence of a 
      statistically significant difference between ADMA levels in young adults born 
      preterm at extremely low birth weight (<1000 g; ex-ELBW) and those of a control 
      group of healthy adults born at term (C) and 2) to seek correlations between ADMA 
      levels in ex-ELBW and anthropometric and clinical parameters (gender, 
      chronological age, gestational age, birth weight, and duration of stay in 
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). METHODS: Thirty-two ex-ELBW subjects (11 males [M] 
      and 21 females [F], aged 17-29years, mean age 22.2 +/- 2.3 years) were compared 
      with 25 C (7 M and 18F). ADMA levels were assessed by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography with highly sensitive laser fluorescent detection. RESULTS: ADMA 
      levels were reduced in ex-ELBW subjects compared to C (0.606+0.095 vs 0.562+0.101 
      mumol/L, p<0.05), and significantly correlated inversely with gestational age 
      (r=-0.61, p<0.00001) and birth weight (r=-0.57, p<0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects 
      compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low 
      birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early 
      circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Informed consent for total hip arthroplasty: does a written information sheet 
      improve recall by patients?
PG  - 404-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether a written information sheet is acceptable to 
      patients and improves recall of the consent interview. DESIGN: Prospective 
      randomised controlled study using questionnaires, comparing a group of patients 
      given information in a written sheet with appropriate explanation to a group 
      given verbal information alone. SETTING: A specialist orthopaedic surgery unit. 
      PATIENTS: The test group was 126 patients undergoing revision or primary total 
      hip arthroplasty; 65 patients were given information verbally, 61 patients were 
      given written information. OUTCOME MEASURE: Patients' recall of information 
      given, tested with a questionnaire completed on admission (mean of 18 days 
      later). RESULTS: The patients receiving written information scored significantly 
      higher (48% correct answers) than the patients receiving verbal information (38% 
      correct answers). CONCLUSIONS: Written information sheets contribute to the 
      process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally 
      poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what 
      was discussed.

TI  - Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still 
      matter?
PG  - 32-8
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.544 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate surgical outcome and survival benefit after quaternary 
      cytoreduction (QC) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) relapse. METHODS: We 
      systematically evaluated all consecutive patients undergoing QC in our 
      institution over a 12-year period (October 2000-January 2012). All relevant 
      surgical and clinical outcome parameters were systematically assessed. RESULTS: 
      Forty-nine EOC patients (median age: 57; range: 28-76) underwent QC; in a median 
      of 16 months (range:2-142) after previous chemotherapy. The majority of the 
      patients had an initial FIGO stage III (67.3%), peritoneal carcinomatosis (77.6%) 
      and no ascites (67.3%). At QC, patients presented following tumour pattern: lower 
      abdomen 85.7%; middle abdomen 79.6% and upper abdomen 42.9%. Median duration of 
      surgery was 292 min (range: a total macroscopic tumour clearance could be 
      achieved. Rates of major operative morbidity and 30-day mortality were 28.6% and 
      2%, respectively.Mean follow-up from QC was 18.41 months (95% confidence interval 
      (CI):12.64-24.18) and mean overall survival (OS) 23.05 months (95% CI: 
      15.5-30.6). Mean OS for patients without vs any tumour residuals was 43 months 
      (95% CI: 26.4-59.5) vs 13.4 months (95% CI: 7.42-19.4); P=0.001. Mean OS for 
      patients who received postoperative chemotherapy (n=18; 36.7%) vs those who did 
      not was 40.5 months (95% CI: 27.4-53.6) vs 12.03 months (95% CI: 5.9-18.18); 
      P<0.001.Multivariate analysis indentified multifocal tumour dissemination to be 
      of predictive significance for incomplete tumour resection, higher operative 
      morbidity and lower survival, while systemic chemotherapy subsequent to QC had a 
      protective significant impact on OS. No prognostic impact had ascites, platinum 
      resistance, high grading and advanced age. CONCLUSION: Even in this highly 
      advanced setting of the third EOC relapse, maximal therapeutic effort combining 
      optimal surgery and chemotherapy appear to significantly prolong survival in a 
      selected patients 'group'.

AB  - PURPOSE: This clinical study investigated whether the vascular-guided multilayer 
      preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) could improve 
      access and decrease complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective 
      evaluation consisted of a consecutive series of patients who underwent TMJ 
      surgeries through the VMPA from January through December 2013. Patients with a 
      history of TMJ surgery were excluded. Clinical data, including operating times, 
      subjective complaints of incision scars, functional conditions of the 
      auriculotemporal nerve and facial nerve, and other complications, were recorded 
      and analyzed. All patients in this study were followed for at least 6 months. 
      RESULTS: All patients (606 joints) had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA. 
      All incisions healed favorably with an uneventful recovery. No patient developed 
      permanent weakness of the facial nerve or other severe complications. CONCLUSION: 
      The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and 
      yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the 
      approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.

TI  - Hepatic arterial embolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas: do 
      technical factors affect prognosis?
PG  - 560-6
LID - 10.1007/s11604-012-0088-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively whether technical factors of hepatic 
      arterial embolization affect the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria of this study were the 
      following: (1) patients received embolization as the initial treatment during 
      2003-2004, (2) Child A or B liver profile, (3) five or fewer HCCs with maximum 
      diameter of 7 cm or smaller, and (4) no extrahepatic metastasis. Patient data 
      were gathered from 43 centers. Prognostic factors were evaluated using univariate 
      and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Eight hundred fifteen patients were enrolled. 
      The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates were 92.0 % (95 % CI 
      90.1-93.9), 62.9 % (95 % CI 59.3-66.6), 39.0 % (95 % CI 35.1-43.0), and 26.7 % 
      (95 % CI 22.6-30.8) in all patients. Univariate analysis showed a Child-Pugh 
      class-A, alpha-fetoprotein level lower than 100 ng/ml, tumor size of 3 cm or 
      smaller, tumor number of 3 or fewer, one-lobe tumor distribution, nodular tumor 
      type, within the Milan criteria, stage I or II, no portal venous invasion, use of 
      iodized oil, and selective embolization were significantly better prognostic 
      factors. In the multivariate Cox model, the benefit to survival of selective 
      embolization remained significant (hazard ratio 0.68; 95 % CI 0.48-0.97; p = 
      0.033). CONCLUSION: Selective embolization contributes to survival in patients 
      with HCCs.

TI  - Is plate clearing a risk factor for obesity? A cross-sectional study of 
      self-reported data in US adults.
PG  - 301-4
LID - 10.1002/oby.20976 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identifying eating behaviors which contribute to excess weight gain 
      will inform obesity prevention strategies. A tendency to clear one's plate when 
      eating may be a risk factor for obesity in an environment where food is 
      plentiful. Whether plate clearing is associated with increased body weight in a 
      cohort of US participants was examined. METHODS: Nine hundred and ninety-three US 
      adults (60% male, 80% American European, mean age=31 years) completed self-report 
      measures of habitual plate clearing together with behavioral and demographic 
      characteristics known to be associated with obesity. RESULTS: Plate clearing 
      tendencies were positively associated with BMI and remained so after accounting 
      for a large number of other demographic and behavioral predictors of BMI in 
      analyses (beta=0.18, 95% CIs=0.07, 0.29, P<0.001); an increased tendency to plate 
      clear was associated with a significantly higher body weight. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body 
      weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.

TI  - Outcomes of severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health 
      service: does trauma center level make a difference?
PG  - 2332-40
LID - 10.1007/s00268-011-1217-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trauma centers are designated to provide systematized 
      multidisciplinary care to injured patients. Effective trauma systems reduce 
      patient mortality by facilitating the treatment of injured patients at 
      appropriately resourced hospitals. Several U.S. studies report reduced mortality 
      among patients admitted directly to a level I trauma center compared with those 
      admitted to hospitals with less resources. It has yet to be shown whether there 
      is an outcome benefit associated with the "level of hospital" initially treating 
      severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to 
      determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts 
      mortality and/or hospital length of stay. METHODS: Outcomes were evaluated for 
      severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 using 
      NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management data from 2002-2007 for our 
      regional health service. To assess the association between trauma centers and 
      binary outcomes, a logistic regression model was used. To assess the association 
      between trauma centers and continuous outcomes, a multivariable linear regression 
      model was used. Sex, age, and ISS were included as covariates in all models. 
      RESULTS: There were 1,986 trauma presentations during the 6-year period. Patients 
      presenting to a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death 
      than those presenting to the level I center, regardless of age, sex, ISS, or 
      prehospital time. Peer review of deaths at the level III center identified 
      problems in care delivery in 15 cases associated with technical errors, delay in 
      decision making, or errors of judgement. CONCLUSION: Severely injured patients 
      treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a 
      level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and 
      were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance 
      of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance 
      monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.

TI  - Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand 
      bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/1475-2840-7-18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and 
      insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear 
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in 
      lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon 
      cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate 
      suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer 
      development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a 
      possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in 
      patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. METHODS: Our 
      population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled 
      in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. 
      The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or 
      placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by 
      matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. 
      Each matched record was checked for correct identification. RESULTS: Development 
      of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients 
      from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of 
      colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the 
      bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: 
      one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer 
      was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued 
      follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who 
      received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% 
      confidence interval 0.2-1.1. CONCLUSION: Our data, derived from patients with 
      coronary artery disease, support the hypothesis regarding a possible preventive 
      effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer.

TI  - Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and frequency of severe hypoglycaemia in Type 
      1 diabetes: does a relationship exist?
PG  - 1449-54
AB  - AIMS: An association has been described between elevated serum 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia 
      (SH). To ascertain whether this reported association could be replicated in a 
      different country, it was re-examined in 300 individuals with Type 1 diabetes. 
      METHODS: People with Type 1 diabetes, none of whom was taking renin-angiotensin 
      system blocking drugs, were recruited. Participants recorded the frequency with 
      which they had experienced SH. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and serum ACE were 
      measured. The difference in the incidence of SH between different quartiles of 
      ACE activity and the relationship between serum ACE and SH were examined using 
      non-parametric statistical tests and a negative binomial model. RESULTS: Data 
      were obtained from 300 patients [158 male; HbA(1c) median (range) 8.2% 
      (5.2-12.8%), median age 36 years (16-88); duration of diabetes 14.5 years 
      (2-49)]. The incidence of SH was 0.93 episodes per patient year. The mean 
      incidence of SH in the top and bottom quartiles of ACE activity was 0.5 and 1.7 
      episodes per patient year, respectively, but this difference was not 
      statistically significant (P = 0.075). Spearman's test showed a very weak, 
      although statistically significant, association between serum ACE level and SH 
      incidence (r = 0.115, P = 0.047). The binomial model also showed a statistically 
      significant (P = 0.002), but clinically weak, relationship between serum ACE and 
      SH. CONCLUSIONS: The present survey showed a weak relationship between serum ACE 
      and the frequency of SH, the clinical relevance of which is unclear. This limits 
      the proposed role for serum ACE as an index of risk for SH.

TI  - Hypotension in patients with coronary disease: can profound hypotensive events 
      cause myocardial ischaemic events?
PG  - 477-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anginal episodes might be related to extremes of 
      hypotension in patients with ischaemic heart disease taking drugs to treat angina 
      and heart failure. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study of patients with 
      ischaemic heart disease attending an urban tertiary referral cardiology centre. 
      INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: A selected patient population was enrolled, 
      having: angina on one or more hypotensive cardiovascular medications; hypotension 
      on clinic or ambulatory measurement; and a resting ECG suitable for ambulatory 
      monitoring. Patients had echocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 
      and Holter monitoring. Hypotension induced ischaemic (HII) events were defined as 
      episodes of ST segment ischaemia occurring at least one minute after an 
      ambulatory blood pressure measurement (systolic/diastolic) below 100/65 mm Hg 
      during the day, or 90/50 mm Hg at night. RESULTS: 25 suitable patients were 
      enrolled, and 107 hypotensive events were documented. 40 ST events occurred in 14 
      patients, of which a quarter were symptomatic. Fourteen HII events occurred in 
      eight patients, with 13 of the 14 preceded by a fall in diastolic pressure 
      (median diastolic pressure 57.5 mm Hg, interquartile range 11, maximum 72 mm Hg, 
      minimum 45 mm Hg), and six preceded by a fall in systolic pressure (chi(2) = 
      11.9, p < 0.001). ST events were significantly associated with preceding 
      hypotensive events (chi(2) = 40.2, p < 0.0001). Patients with HII events were 
      more frequently taking multiple hypotensive drug regimens (8/8 v 9/17, chi(2) = 
      5.54, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ischaemic heart disease and 
      hypotension, symptomatic and silent ischaemia occurred in a temporally causal 
      relation with hypotension, particularly for diastolic pressures, suggesting that 
      patients with coronary disease may be susceptible to ischaemic events incurred as 
      a result of low blood pressure caused by excessive hypotensive drug treatment.

TI  - Measuring hospital mortality rates: are 30-day data enough? Ischemic Heart 
      Disease Patient Outcomes Research Team.
PG  - 679-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compare 30-day and 180-day postadmission hospital mortality rates 
      for all Medicare patients and those in three categories of cardiac care: coronary 
      artery bypass graft surgery, acute myocardial infarction, and congestive heart 
      failure. DATA SOURCES/COLLECTION: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 
      hospital mortality data for FY 1989. STUDY DESIGN: Using hospital level public 
      use files of actual and predicted mortality at 30 and 180 days, we constructed 
      residual mortality measures for each hospital. We ranked hospitals and used 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to compare 0-30, 31-180, and 
      0-180-day postadmission mortality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For the admissions we 
      studied, we found a broad range of hospital performance when we ranked hospitals 
      using the 30-day data; some hospitals had much lower than predicted 30-day 
      mortality rates, while others had much higher than predicted mortality rates. 
      Data from the time period 31-180 days postadmission yield results that 
      corroborate the 0-30 day postadmission data. Moreover, we found evidence that 
      hospital performance on one condition is related to performance on the other 
      conditions, but that the correlation is much weaker in the 31-180-day interval 
      than in the 0-30-day period. Using ROC curves, we found that the 30-day data 
      discriminated the top and bottom fifths of the 180-day data extremely well, 
      especially for AMI outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Using data on cumulative hospital 
      mortality from 180 days postadmission does not yield a different perspective from 
      using data from 30 days postadmission for the conditions we studied.

TI  - Is the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by 
      the surgeon's previous experience?
PG  - 315-20
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of the urologist's experience on the surgical 
      results and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients undergoing transurethral resection of 
      the prostate without the use of a video camera were randomly allocated into three 
      groups according to the urologist's experience: a urologist having done 25 
      transurethral resections of the prostate (Group I - 24 patients); a urologist 
      having done 50 transurethral resections of the prostate (Group II - 24 patients); 
      a senior urologist with vast transurethral resection of the prostate experience 
      (Group III - 19 patients). The following were recorded: the weight of resected 
      tissue, the duration of the resection procedure, the volume of irrigation used, 
      the amount of irrigation absorbed and the hemoglobin and sodium levels in the 
      serum during the procedure. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups 
      in the amount of irrigation fluid used per operation, the amount of irrigation 
      fluid absorbed or hematocrit and hemoglobin variation during the procedure. The 
      weight of resected tissue per minute was approximately four times higher in group 
      III than in groups I and II. The mean absorbed irrigation fluid was similar 
      between the groups, with no statistical difference between them (p=0.24). Four 
      patients (6%) presented with TUR syndrome, without a significant difference 
      between the groups. CONCLUSION: The senior urologist was capable of resecting 
      four times more tissue per time unit than the more inexperienced surgeons. 
      Therefore, a surgeon's experience may be important to reduce the risk of 
      secondary TURP due to recurring adenomas or adenomas that were incompletely 
      resected. However, the incidence of complications was the same between the three 
      groups.

TI  - [Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced 
      urticaria?].
PG  - 1111-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apparent life-threatening events in infants are a difficult and 
      frequent problem in pediatric practice. The prognosis is uncertain because of 
      risk of sudden infant death syndrome. CASE REPORTS: Eight infants aged 2 to 15 
      months were admitted during a period of 6 years; they suffered from similar 
      maladies in the bath: on immersion, they became pale, hypotonic, still and 
      unreactive; recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and 
      stimulation. Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal 
      reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic 
      urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's 
      family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after 
      exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase 
      in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The 
      evolution of these "aquagenic maladies" was favourable after a few weeks without 
      baths. After a 2-7 year follow-up, three out of seven infants continue to suffer 
      from troubles associated with sun or water. CONCLUSION: "Aquagenic maladies" 
      could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.

TI  - Do women residents delay childbearing due to perceived career threats?
PG  - 640-6
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d2cb5b [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess gender differences among residents regarding their plans to 
      have children during residency and determine the most influential reasons for 
      these differences. METHOD: Using the Health Belief Model as a framework, the 
      authors created an instrument to survey 424 residents from 11 residency programs 
      at three academic medical institutions about their intentions to have children 
      during residency. The authors developed a scale to assess the perceived career 
      threats of having children during residency, evaluated its psychometric 
      properties, and calculated the effect of the mediators. RESULTS: The response 
      rate was 77% (328/424). Forty-one percent of men versus 27% of women planned to 
      have children during residency (P = .01). The instrument measured four career 
      threats-extended training, loss of fellowship positions, pregnancy complications, 
      and interference with career plans-on a five-point Likert scale. The scale had a 
      Cronbach alpha of 0.84 and an eigenvalue of 2.2. Compared with men, women had 
      higher scores for each item and a higher mean score (2.9 versus 2.1, P = .001), 
      signifying greater belief in the potential of pregnancy to threaten careers. 
      After adjusting for age, institution, postgraduate year, and knowledge of 
      parental leave policies, women were less likely to plan to have children during 
      residency (odds ratio 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.84]). In mediation 
      analysis, threats to career explained 67% of the gender variance. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Women residents intentionally postpone pregnancy because of perceived threats to 
      their careers. Medical educators should be aware of these findings when 
      counseling female trainees.

TI  - Is trabecular bone related to primary stability of miniscrews?
PG  - 500-7
LID - 10.2319/052513-39.1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the primary stability of miniscrews inserted into bone 
      blocks of different bone mineral densities (BMDs) with and without cortical bone, 
      and investigate whether some trabecular properties could influence primary 
      stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two bone blocks were extracted from fresh 
      bovine pelvic bone. Four groups were created based on bone type (iliac or pubic 
      region) and presence or absence of cortical bone. Specimens were micro-computed 
      tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular 
      separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 
      1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary 
      stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), 
      and pull-out strength (PS). RESULTS: Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of 
      primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of 
      cortical bone (P</=.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between 
      trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and 
      IT, PTV, and PS. There was correlation between cortical thickness and IT and PS 
      (P</=.05). CONCLUSION: Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability 
      of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.

TI  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict 
      outcome?
PG  - 54-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to delineate early respiratory predictors 
      of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective chart review of children with malignant and ARDS who needed 
      mechanical ventilation and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from 
      January 1987 to January 1997. RESULTS: Seventeen children with ARDS and 
      malignancy aged 10.5 +/- 5.1 years were identified. Six of the 17 children 
      (35.3%) survived. Sepsis syndrome was present in 70.6% of all the children. Peak 
      inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation 
      index values could distinguish outcome by day 3. A significant relationship 
      between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation, as 
      determined by PaO(2)/FIO(2) and P(A-a)O(2), was present from day 8 after onset of 
      mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and 
      ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. 
      This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in 
      children with malignancy and ARDS.

TI  - Neoadjuvant Imatinib in Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal stromal Tumours, Will 
      Kit Mutation Analysis Be a Pathfinder?
PG  - 381-388
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Longer duration of neoadjuvant (NA) imatinib (IM) used for locally 
      advanced (LA) gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) is not based on biology of 
      the tumour reflected by kit mutation analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LA or 
      locally recurrent (LR) GIST treated with NA IM from May 2008 to March 2015 from a 
      prospective database were included in the analysis. Archived formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) were used for testing KIT exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 
      by PCR. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients with LA or LR GIST were treated 
      with NA IM. Forty-five patients (36 %) had undergone c-kit mutation testing. Exon 
      11 was seen in 25 patients (55.5 %), 3 with exon 9 (6.7 %) and 2 with exon 13 
      (4.4 %). Twelve were wild type (26.6 %) and  3 (6.7 %) were declared 
      uninterpretable. Response rate (RR) for the exon 11 mutants was higher than the 
      non-exon 11 mutant group (84 vs. 40 %, p = 0.01). Disease stabilization rate 
      (DSR) rates were also higher in the exon 11 subgroup than non-exon 11 group (92 
      vs. 75 %). Eighty-four per cent exon 11 and 75 % non-exon 11 mutants were 
      surgical candidates. Patients undergoing surgery had significantly improved event 
      free survival (EFS) (p < 0.001) compared to patients not undergoing surgery, with 
      the same trend seen in OS (p = 0.021). Patients with a SD on response to NA IM 
      had a lower EFS (p = 0.076) and OS compared to patients achieving CR/PR. There 
      were no differences between the various exon variants in terms of outcomes and 
      responses CONCLUSION: Upfront evaluation of kit mutation status may help us in 
      delineating separate treatment strategies for potentially biologically different 
      tumours and assessing the correct timing of surgery for this subset of GIST.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of obesity at the start of adolescence on the 
      prevalence, incidence and maintenance of chest wheezing among individuals aged 
      11-15 years in a birth cohort in a developing country. METHODS: The seventh 
      follow-up of the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort occurred in 2004 (individuals aged 
      10-11 years). Between January and August 2008, the eighth follow-up of the cohort 
      was conducted. All the individuals of the original cohort who were alive (who 
      were then adolescents aged between 14 and 15 years) were targets for the study. 
      The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) 
      questionnaire was used to define wheezing. In addition to the body mass index 
      (BMI), used to define obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, we 
      assessed skinfold thickness. RESULTS: From the original cohort, 4,349 individuals 
      were located (85.7% follow-up rate). The prevalence of chest wheezing at 11 and 
      15 years were 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.5%) and 12.1% (95% CI: 11.1%-13.1%), 
      respectively. The prevalence of wheezing at both times was 4.5% (95% CI: 
      3.9%-5.1%) and the incidence of wheezing was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). 
      Independent of the effect of various confounding variables, the prevalence of 
      wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic 
      individuals at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05). The greater the skinfold 
      tertile at 11 years, the higher the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was (p = 
      .011). Weight status and skinfolds did not present any association with incident 
      wheezing. After controlling for confounding factors, the risk of persistent 
      wheezing among obese individuals at 11 years was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.30-2.54). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Since obesity at the start of adolescence is associated with asthma 
      symptom persistence, prevention and treatment of obesity may reduce avoidable 
      healthcare costs and disease burden.

TI  - Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive?
PG  - 340-7
LID - 10.1080/15389580903043446 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: ESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology 
      that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although 
      past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision 
      rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, 
      drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that 
      could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the 
      present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to 
      occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. 
      Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey 
      and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and 
      ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. METHODS: Two separate telephone 
      surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 
      500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 
      1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the 
      provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. RESULTS: Though ESC drivers 
      were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 
      39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had 
      never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was 
      equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being 
      confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners 
      who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their 
      driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, 
      results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; 
      however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in 
      a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To 
      fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market 
      ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety 
      organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information 
      about ESC to their members.

TI  - Does a geriatric oncology consultation modify the cancer treatment plan for 
      elderly patients?
PG  - 724-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed to describe the treatment plan modifications 
      after a geriatric oncology clinic. Assessment of health and functional status and 
      cancer assessment was performed in older cancer patients referred to a cancer 
      center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2004 and May 2005, 105 patients 70 
      years old or older referred to a geriatric oncology consultation at the Institut 
      Curie cancer center were included. Functional status, nutritional status, mood, 
      mobility, comorbidity, medication, social support, and place of residence were 
      assessed. Oncology data and treatment decisions were recorded before and after 
      this consultation. Data were analyzed for a possible correlation between one 
      domain of the assessment and modification of the treatment plan. RESULTS: Patient 
      characteristics included a median age of 79 years and a predominance of women 
      with breast cancer. About one half of patients had an independent functional 
      status. Nearly 15% presented severe undernourishment. Depression was suspected in 
      53.1% of cases. One third of these patients had >2 chronic diseases, and 74% of 
      patients took > or =3 medications. Of the 93 patients with an initial treatment 
      decision, the treatment plan was modified for 38.7% of cases after this 
      assessment. Only body mass index and the absence of depressive symptoms were 
      associated with a modification of the treatment plan. CONCLUSION: The geriatric 
      oncology consultation led to a modification of the cancer treatment plan in more 
      than one third of cases. Further studies are needed to determine whether these 
      modifications improve the outcome of these older patients.

TI  - Can students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations predict 
      that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination?
PG  - 516-20
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31820de435 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine whether preclerkship performance 
      examinations could accurately identify medical students at risk for failing a 
      senior clinical performance examination (CPE). METHOD: This study used a 
      retrospective case-control, multiyear design, with contingency table analyses, to 
      examine the performance of 412 students in the classes of 2005 to 2010 at a 
      midwestern medical school. During their second year, these students took four 
      CPEs that each used three standardized patient (SP) cases, for a total of 12 
      cases. The authors correlated each student's average year 2 case score with the 
      student's average case score on a senior (year 4) CPE. Contingency table analysis 
      was carried out using performance on the year 2 CPEs and passing/failing the 
      senior CPE. Similar analyses using each student's United States Medical Licensing 
      Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores were also performed. Sensitivity, specificity, 
      odds ratio, and relative risk were calculated for two year 2 performance 
      standards. RESULTS: Students' low performances relative to their class on the 
      year 2 CPEs were a strong predictor that they would fail the senior CPE. Their 
      USMLE Step 1 scores also correlated with their performance on the senior CPE, 
      although the predictive values for these scores were considerably weaker. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs 
      strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This 
      finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during 
      clerkships.

TI  - Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: can their reading comprehension 
      ability be improved?
PG  - 835-49
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with a mild intellectual disability (ID) often show poor 
      decoding and reading comprehension skills. The goal of this study was to 
      investigate the effects of teaching text comprehension strategies to these 
      adults. Specific research goals were to determine (1) the effects of two 
      instruction conditions, i.e. strategy instruction to individuals and strategy 
      instruction in small groups in a reciprocal teaching context; (2) intervention 
      programme effects on specific strategy tests (so-called direct effects), and 
      possible differences between strategies; (3) (long-term) transfer effects of the 
      programme on general reading comprehension ability; and (4) the regression of 
      general text comprehension by the variables of technical reading, IQ, reading 
      comprehension of sentences (RCS), and pretest and posttest scores on the 
      strategies taught. METHODS: In total, 38 adults (age range 20-72 years; mean age 
      of 36 years) with ID participated in the study. IQs ranged from 45 to 69 with a 
      mean IQ of 58. The intervention programme involved 15 weekly lessons of 1 h each, 
      taught during 3 months. Blocks of lessons included each of Brown and Palincsar's 
      strategies of summarizing, questioning, clarifying and predicting, as 
      participants read and studied narrative and expository texts. RESULTS: Results 
      indicated no significant difference between group and individual instruction 
      conditions. Second, direct programme effects - as determined by posttest-pretest 
      contrasts for strategy tests - were substantial, except for the questioning 
      strategy. Third, even more substantial was the transfer effect to general text 
      comprehension. Moreover, the results on this test were well maintained at a 
      follow-up test. Finally, the variance of general reading comprehension ability 
      was best explained by the test of RCS, and only moderately by the strategies 
      trained. CONCLUSION: The presently used intervention programme provides a good 
      starting point for adults with ID to become better readers.

TI  - Can nurse-led preoperative education reduce anxiety and postoperative 
      complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery?
PG  - 447-58
LID - 10.1177/1474515115602678 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative 
      outcomes of cardiac surgery patients remains unclear. AIM: The aim of the study 
      was to estimate the effectiveness of a nurse-led preoperative education on 
      anxiety and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: A randomised controlled study was 
      designed. All the patients who were admitted for elective cardiac surgery in a 
      general hospital in Athens with knowledge of the Greek language were eligible to 
      take part in the study. Patients in the intervention group received preoperative 
      education by specially trained nurses. The control group received the standard 
      information by the ward personnel. Measurements of anxiety were conducted on 
      admission-A, before surgery-B and before discharge-C by the state-trait anxiety 
      inventory. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 395 patients (intervention group: 
      205, control group: 190). The state anxiety on the day before surgery decreased 
      only in the intervention group (34.0 (8.4) versus 36.9 (10.7); P=0.001). The mean 
      decrease in state score during the follow-up period was greater in the 
      intervention group (P=0.001). No significant difference was found in the length 
      of stay or readmission. Lower proportions of chest infection were found in the 
      intervention group (10 (5.3) versus 1 (0.5); P=0.004). Multivariate linear 
      regression revealed that education and score in trait anxiety scale on admission 
      are independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety. CONCLUSION: 
      Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative 
      complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in 
      reducing readmissions or length of stay.

TI  - Is there a relationship between homocysteine and vitiligo? A pilot study.
PG  - 720-4
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08712.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pigmentary dilution is observed in patients with homocystinuria. 
      Therefore, it is possible that an increase of local homocysteine (Hcy) interferes 
      with normal melanogenesis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. 
      Vitamin B12 and folic acid, levels of which are decreased in vitiligo, are 
      important cofactors in the metabolism of Hcy. Consequently, a nutritional 
      deficiency in either of these two vitamins will result in an increase in 
      homocysteine in the circulation, a finding that we expect to find in vitiligo. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo 
      as a first step in revealing if it has any relationship with the pathogenesis of 
      vitiligo and consequently if this will have an impact on the treatment of 
      vitiligo. METHODS: Twenty-six patients of both sexes with vitiligo (age range 
      20-50 years, mean 31.4 +/- 8.09) and 26 age-matched healthy controls were 
      included in the study. After excluding factors that may affect serum Hcy levels, 
      blood samples from patients and controls were obtained for homocysteine 
      determination by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: The mean serum level of Hcy was 
      significantly higher in patients with vitiligo than in controls (21.61 +/- 13.28 
      vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). The Hcy level was significantly 
      higher in male patients than in female patients (28.67 +/- 15.95 vs. 15.56 +/- 
      6.2 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001) and in male controls compared with female controls 
      (15.07 +/- 4.61 vs. 12.05 +/- 4.82 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). The homocysteine 
      level was related to the activity of vitiligo and was significantly higher in 
      patients with progressive disease than in controls (25.4 +/- 14.99 vs. 13.1 +/- 
      4.88 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). No significant difference in Hcy levels was 
      found between either untreated vitiligo patients (22.77 +/- 13.36 micromol L(-1)) 
      or patients receiving ultraviolet therapy (20.45 +/- 13.73 micromol L(-1)) and 
      the total patient group (21.62 +/- 13.28 micromol L(-1)). CONCLUSION: An elevated 
      homocysteine level may be a precipitating factor for vitiligo in predisposed 
      individuals. In view of the biological role of vitamin B(12) and folic acid in 
      Hcy metabolism, we present our recommendations regarding the investigation and 
      treatment of this common disease.

TI  - [Does para-cervical block offer additional advantages in abortion induction with 
      gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?].
PG  - 621-4
AB  - Uterus-specific synthetic Prostaglandin analogues (gemeprost, sulproston etc.) 
      have been widely employed for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. 
      Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we 
      investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical 
      course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of 
      labour. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal 
      reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg 
      gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women 
      received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 
      women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% 
      Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm. RESULTS: A median of 3 
      gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without 
      paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours 
      (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the 
      paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of 
      prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were 
      slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. 
      The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p < 0.05). 
      The requirement of Pethidin and the intensity of pain (measured by pain scale 
      according to Huskisson) especially in the late first stage of labour were not 
      statistically different between both groups. Side effects of paracervical 
      anaesthesia did not occur. CONCLUSION: Paracervical anaesthesia is a method for 
      analgesia during second trimester abortion with a low rate of side effects. It 
      can shorten the duration of last period of second trimester abortion in some 
      cases but has no impact on the perception of pain nor requirement of analgesics 
      and so with only limited benefit in second trimester abortion with vaginal 
      gemeprost.

TI  - Is a 9-month treatment sufficient in tuberculous enterocolitis? A prospective, 
      randomized, single-centre study.
PG  - 85-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis has increased in parallel with the acquired 
      immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, and 
      the growing incidence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially with intestinal 
      involvement, reflects this trend. However, the duration of anti-tuberculous 
      therapy has not been clarified in intestinal tuberculosis. AIM: To compare the 
      efficacy of different treatment durations in tuberculous enterocolitis in terms 
      of response and recurrence rates. METHODS: Forty patients with tuberculous 
      enterocolitis were randomized prospectively: 22 patients into a 9-month and 18 
      into a 15-month group. Diagnosis was made either by colonoscopic findings of 
      discrete ulcers and histopathological findings of caseating granuloma and/or 
      acid-fast bacilli, or by clinical improvement after therapeutic trial. Patients 
      were followed up with colonoscopy every other month until complete response or 
      treatment completion, and then every 6 months for 1 year and annually. Complete 
      response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by 
      colonoscopy. RESULTS: Complete response was obtained in all patients in both 
      groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent 
      operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No 
      recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period 
      in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculous enterocolitis can be managed by 9-month 
      chemotherapy without disease recurrence. Further investigations are needed in 
      immunocompromised patients.

TI  - Reporting and interpreting red blood cell morphology: is there discordance 
      between clinical pathologists and clinicians?
PG  - 487-95
LID - 10.1111/vcp.12202 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical pathologists (CPs) report RBC morphologic (RBC-M) changes to 
      assist clinicians in prioritizing differential diagnoses. However, reporting is 
      subjective, semiquantitative, and potentially biased. Reporting decisions vary 
      among CPs, and reports may not be interpreted by clinicians as intended. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to survey clinicians and CPs about RBC-M 
      terms and their clinical value, and identify areas of agreement and discordance. 
      METHODS: Online surveys were distributed to small animal clinicians via the 
      Veterinary Information Network and to CPs via the ASVCP listserv. A quiz assessed 
      understanding of RBC-M terms among respondent groups. Descriptive statistics were 
      used to analyze responses to survey questions, and quiz scores were compared 
      among groups. RESULTS: Analyzable responses were obtained from 1662 clinicians 
      and 82 CPs. Both clinicians and CPs considered some terms, e.g., agglutination, 
      useful, whereas only CPs considered other terms, e.g., ghost cells, useful. All 
      groups interpreted certain terms, e.g., Heinz bodies, correctly, whereas some 
      clinicians misinterpreted others, e.g., eccentrocytes. Responses revealed that 
      CPs often do not report RBC-M they consider insignificant, when present in low 
      numbers. Twenty-eight percent of clinicians think CPs review all blood smears 
      while only 19% of CPs report reviewing all smears. CONCLUSIONS: Important 
      differences about the clinical relevance of certain RBC-M terms exist between 
      clinicians and CPs. Inclusion of interpretive comments on CBC reports is the 
      clearest way to ensure that RBC-M changes are interpreted as intended by the CP. 
      Reporting practices should be examined critically to improve communication, 
      transparency, and ultimately medical decisions.

TI  - The inverse equity hypothesis: does it apply to coverage of cancer screening in 
      middle-income countries?
PG  - 149-55
LID - 10.1136/jech-2014-204355 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether the inverse equity hypothesis-the idea that 
      new health interventions are initially primarily accessed by the rich, but that 
      inequalities narrow with diffusion to the poor-holds true for cancer screening in 
      low and middle income countries (LMICs).This study examines the relationship 
      between overall coverage and economic inequalities in coverage of cancer 
      screening in four middle-income countries. METHODS: Secondary analyses of 
      cross-sectional data from the WHO study on Global Ageing and Adult Health in 
      China, Mexico, Russia and South Africa (2007-2010). Three regression-based 
      methods were used to measure economic inequalities: (1) Adjusted OR; (2) Relative 
      Index of Inequality (RII); and (3) Slope Index of Inequality. RESULTS: Coverage 
      for breast cancer screening was 10.5% in South Africa, 19.3% in China, 33.8% in 
      Russia and 43% in Mexico, and coverage for cervical cancer screening was 24% in 
      South Africa, 27.2% in China, 63.7% in Mexico and 81.5% in Russia. Economic 
      inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent 
      in countries with higher aggregate coverage, for both breast cancer screening 
      (RII: 14.57 in South Africa, 4.90 in China, 2.01 in Mexico, 1.04 in Russia) and 
      cervical cancer screening (RII: 3.60 in China, 2.47 in South Africa, 1.39 in 
      Mexico, 1.12 in Russia). CONCLUSIONS: Economic inequalities in breast and 
      cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These 
      findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high 
      levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high 
      income inequality.

TI  - Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role 
      for uterine natural killer cells?
PG  - 5528-35
AB  - CONTEXT: Irregular bleeding affects many users of combined menopausal hormone 
      therapy (HT) and commonly leads to invasive and expensive investigations to 
      exclude underlying malignancy. In most cases no abnormality is found. OBJECTIVE: 
      The main objective of this study was to explore the role of uterine natural 
      killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15 in irregular bleeding in 
      HT users. DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study conducted between 
      2002 and 2004. SETTING: The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause 
      clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. PATIENTS: Patients 
      included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. INTERVENTIONS: Outpatient 
      endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and 
      bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on 
      uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and 
      uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with 
      irregular bleeding. RESULTS: Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly 
      increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), compared 
      with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also 
      seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig 
      like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Little is 
      known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users. This is the 
      first report of uNK cells and their association with regulating cytokines in 
      postmenopausal endometrium and demonstrates a possible mechanism by which HT may 
      induce irregular bleeding.

TI  - Can we ease the financial burden of colonoscopy? Using real-time endoscopic 
      assessment of polyp histology to predict surveillance intervals.
PG  - 1293-9
LID - 10.1111/imj.12917 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyps identified at colonoscopy are predominantly diminutive (<5 mm) 
      with a small risk (>1%) of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma; however, the cost 
      of histological assessment is substantial. AIM: The aim of this study was to 
      determine whether prediction of colonoscopy surveillance intervals based on 
      real-time endoscopic assessment of polyp histology is accurate and cost 
      effective. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted across a tertiary 
      care and private community hospital. Ninety-four patients underwent colonoscopy 
      and polypectomy of diminutive (</=5 mm) polyps from October 2012 to July 2013, 
      yielding a total of 159 polyps. Polyps were examined and classified according to 
      the Sano-Emura classification system. The endoscopic assessment (optical 
      diagnosis) of polyp histology was used to predict appropriate colonoscopy 
      surveillance intervals. The main outcome measure was the accuracy of optical 
      diagnosis of diminutive colonic polyps against the gold standard of histological 
      assessment. RESULTS: Optical diagnosis was correct in 105/108 (97.2%) adenomas. 
      This yielded a sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive 
      values (with 95%CI) of 97.2% (92.1-99.4%), 78.4% (64.7-88.7%), 90.5% (83.7-95.2%) 
      and 93% (80.9-98.5%) respectively. Ninety-two (98%) patients were correctly 
      triaged to their repeat surveillance colonoscopy. Based on these findings, a cut 
      and discard approach would have resulted in a saving of $319.77 per patient. 
      CONCLUSION: Endoscopists within a tertiary care setting can accurately predict 
      diminutive polyp histology and confer an appropriate surveillance interval with 
      an associated financial benefit to the healthcare system. However, limitations to 
      its application in the community setting exist, which may improve with further 
      training and high-definition colonoscopes.

TI  - [Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles? An 
      empirical study in the field of intensive care medicine].

LID - 10.1016/j.medin.2012.04.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some studies suggest that open access articles are more often cited 
      than non-open access articles. However, the relationship between open access and 
      citations count in a discipline such as intensive care medicine has not been 
      studied to date. The present article analyzes the effect of open access 
      publishing of scientific articles in intensive care medicine journals in terms of 
      citations count. METHODS: We evaluated a total of 161 articles (76% being 
      non-open access articles) published in Intensive Care Medicine in the year 2008. 
      Citation data were compared between the two groups up until April 30, 2011. 
      Potentially confounding variables for citation counts were adjusted for in a 
      linear multiple regression model. RESULTS: The median number (interquartile 
      range) of citations of non-open access articles was 8 (4-12) versus 9 (6-18) in 
      the case of open access articles (p=0.084). In the highest citation range (>8), 
      the citation count was 13 (10-16) and 18 (13-21) (p=0.008), respectively. The 
      mean follow-up was 37.5 +/- 3 months in both groups. In the 30-35 months after 
      publication, the average number (mean +/- standard deviation) of citations per 
      article per month of non-open access articles was 0.28 +/- 0.6 versus 0.38 +/- 0.7 in 
      the case of open access articles (p=0.043). Independent factors for citation 
      advantage were the Hirsch index of the first signing author (beta=0.207; p=0.015) 
      and open access status (beta=3.618; p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Open access publishing 
      and the Hirsch index of the first signing author increase the impact of 
      scientific articles. The open access advantage is greater for the more highly 
      cited articles, and appears in the 30-35 months after publication.

TI  - Can biofeedback training of psychophysiological responses enhance athletes' sport 
      performance? A practitioner's perspective.
PG  - 287-99
LID - 10.1080/00913847.2015.1069169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, biofeedback has become increasingly popular for its 
      proven success in peak performance training - the psychophysiological preparation 
      of athletes for high-stakes sport competitions, such as the Olympic games. The 
      aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to 
      biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over 
      competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects. 
      METHODS: Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training 
      in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes 
      (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). 
      All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, 
      was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. 
      Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress 
      tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, 
      the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then 
      calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared 
      with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin 
      conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart 
      respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we 
      questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they 
      continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement 
      in their athletic performance. RESULTS: We demonstrated that a greater number of 
      participants in the experimental group were able to successfully control their 
      psychophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peers in the control 
      group. Significant results (p < 0.05) were noted in regulation of GSR following 
      short stress test conditions (p = 0.037), in regulation of HR after exposure to 
      STROOP stressor (p = 0.037), in regulation of GSR following the Math and GSR 
      stressors (p = 0.033, p = 0.409) and in achieving HR - breathing coherence 
      following the math stressor (p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: One year following 
      completion of the training program, all participants from the experimental group 
      indicated that they were still using the biofeedback - psycho-regulation skills. 
      Furthermore, these participants uniformly reported believing that these skills 
      had enhanced their athletic performance and general well-being.

TI  - Are patients willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical 
      education in regional and rural Australia?
PG  - 150-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Community-based medical education is growing to meet the increased 
      demand for quality clinical education in expanded settings, and its 
      sustainability relies on patient participation. This study investigated patients' 
      views on being used as an educational resource for teaching medical students. 
      DESIGN: Questionnaire-based survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients attending 
      six rural and 11 regional general practices in New South Wales over 18 teaching 
      sessions in November 2008, who consented to student involvement in their 
      consultation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient perceptions, expectations and 
      acceptance of medical student involvement in consultations, assessed by surveys 
      before and after their consultations. RESULTS: 118 of 122 patients consented to 
      medical student involvement; of these, 117 (99%) completed a survey before the 
      consultation, and 100 (85%) after the consultation. Patients were overwhelmingly 
      positive about their doctor and practice being involved in student teaching and 
      felt they themselves played an important role. Pre-consultation, patients 
      expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct some or all aspects of the 
      consultation independently. However, after the consultation, they reported they 
      would have accepted higher levels of involvement than actually occurred. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in 
      developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in 
      patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study 
      extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised 
      partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from 
      regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based 
      medical education in these areas of workforce need.

TI  - Are pectins involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed 
      rape plants?
PG  - 521-30
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcm329 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The hypothesis was tested that pectin content and 
      methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties 
      and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course 
      of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. METHODS: Experiments were carried 
      on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus 
      subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus 
      (Leptosphaeria maculans). KEY RESULTS: Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees 
      C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of 
      freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf 
      tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 
      3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the 
      genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall 
      properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant 
      genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the 
      cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in 
      pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in 
      tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability 
      and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens.

TI  - [The HELPP syndrome--evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in 
      pre-eclampsia?].
PG  - 328-37
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The principal causes of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy in 
      Mexico, are preeclampsia/eclampsia, obstetric hemorrhage and puerperium 
      complications; this is, 62% of maternal deaths in last years. HELLP syndrome was 
      observed between 5 to 25% of the mortality in pregnancies of 36 weeks or less. 
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's (Intensive Care Unit) 
      of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital, related to the abnormal hematological, 
      hepatic and renal results with the obstetric case history and the clinical 
      complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A transversal study in patients with HELLP 
      syndrome during 1998 and 1999 were carry out. CASE DEFINITION: Peripheral blood 
      with Microangiopathic hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes: AST, ALT over 40 UI/L, 
      even when were LDH lower than 600 UI/L. It was evaluated the hepatic and renal 
      function, platelets count, microangiopathic hemolysis, arterial pressure, 
      seizures, icteric skin color, blindness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting 
      and upper quadrant right abdominal pain. In newborn we analyzed gestational age, 
      sex, weight and APGAR. We studied for an association between maternal and 
      biochemical variables with Correlation Pearson Test, and dependence between 
      variables with lineal regression model. RESULTS: 2878 patients with hypertensives 
      disorders in pregnancy (11.64%). The 1.15% (n = 33) had HELLP syndrome with 
      specific maternal mortality of 0.4 per 10,000 live birth, perinatal mortality of 
      1.62 per 10,000 live birth; and renal damage in 84.5%. Coefficient beta was 
      higher between number of pregnancies to platelets count (-0.33) and creatinine 
      clearance (-0.401). CONCLUSION: We found an important renal damage, low 
      platelets, elevated liver enzymes in women with two or more pregnancies. Then we 
      propose there are similarities between HELLP syndrome and Systemic Inflammatory 
      Response Syndrome (SIRS) because they could have the same pathophysiology.

TI  - Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at 
      advanced ages? A twelve-year follow-up of Danish nonagenarians.
PG  - 517-25
LID - 10.1007/s40520-013-0122-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies examining predictors of survival among the 
      oldest-old have primarily focused on objective measures, such as physical 
      function and health status. Only a few studies have examined the effect of 
      personality traits on survival, such as optimism. The aim of this study was to 
      examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old. 
      METHODS: The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey 
      comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total 
      of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey. The 
      baseline in-person interview consisted of a comprehensive questionnaire including 
      physical functioning and health, and a question about whether the respondent had 
      an optimistic, neutral or pessimistic outlook on his or her own future. RESULTS: 
      During the follow-up period of 12 years (1998-2010) there were 2,239 deaths (99 
      %) in the 1905 Cohort Survey. Univariable analyses revealed that optimistic women 
      and men were at lower risk of death compared to their neutral counterparts [HR 
      0.82, 95 % CI (0.73-0.93) and 0.81, 95 % CI (0.66-0.99), respectively]. When 
      confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and 
      disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival 
      weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were 
      still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI 
      (0.74-0.97)]. The risk of death was also decreased for optimistic men compared to 
      their neutral counterparts, but the effect was non-significant [HR 0.91, 95 % CI 
      (0.73-1.13)]. CONCLUSION: An optimistic outlook appears to be a significant 
      predictor of survival among the oldest-old women. It may also be a significant 
      predictor for men but the sample size is small.

TI  - Is combined therapy more effective than growth hormone or hyperbaric oxygen alone 
      in the healing of left ischemic and non-ischemic colonic anastomoses?
PG  - 1440-5
LID - 10.6061/clinics/2013(11)10 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the effects of growth hormone (GH), 
      hyperbaric oxygen and combined therapy on normal and ischemic colonic anastomoses 
      in rats. METHODS: Eighty male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups 
      (n = 10). In the first four groups, non-ischemic colonic anastomosis was 
      performed, whereas in the remaining four groups, ischemic colonic anastomosis was 
      performed. In groups 5, 6, 7, and 8, colonic ischemia was established by ligating 
      2 cm of the mesocolon on either side of the anastomosis. The control groups (1 
      and 5) received no treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was initiated immediately 
      after surgery and continued for 4 days in groups 3 and 4. Groups 2 and 6 received 
      recombinant human growth hormone, whereas groups 4 and 8 received GH and 
      hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Relaparotomy was performed on postoperative day 4, 
      and a perianastomotic colon segment 2 cm in length was excised for the detection 
      of biochemical and mechanical parameters of anastomotic healing and 
      histopathological evaluation. RESULTS: Combined treatment with hyperbaric oxygen 
      and GH increased the mean bursting pressure values in all of the groups, and a 
      statistically significant increase was noted in the ischemic groups compared to 
      the controls (p<0.05). This improvement was more evident in the ischemic and 
      normal groups treated with combined therapy. In addition, a histopathological 
      evaluation of anastomotic neovascularization and collagen deposition showed 
      significant differences among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with 
      recombinant human growth hormone and hyperbaric oxygen resulted in a favorable 
      therapeutic effect on the healing of ischemic colonic anastomoses.

TI  - The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: are they worth the price?
PG  - S3-6
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2008.14.S4-A.3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specialty pharmaceuticals have evolved beyond their status as niche 
      drugs designed to treat rare conditions and are now poised to become the standard 
      of care in a wide variety of common chronic illnesses. Due in part to the cost of 
      these therapies, payers are increasingly demanding evidence of their value. 
      Determining the value of these medications is hampered by a lack of robust 
      pharmacoeconomic data. OBJECTIVE: To outline emerging strategies and case study 
      examples for the medical and pharmacy benefits management of specialty 
      pharmaceuticals. SUMMARY: The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: increased 
      life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, 
      decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending comes at a 
      significant cost. These agents require special handling, administration, patient 
      education, clinical support, and risk mitigation. Additionally, specialty drugs 
      require distribution systems that ensure appropriate patient selection and data 
      collection. With the specialty pharmaceutical pipeline overflowing with new 
      medicines and an aging population increasingly relying on these novel treatments 
      to treat common diseases, the challenge of managing the costs associated with 
      these agents can be daunting. Aided by sophisticated pharmacoeconomic models to 
      assess value, the cost impacts of these specialty drugs can be appropriately 
      controlled. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that when used in targeted 
      patient populations, specialty pharmaceuticals may represent a good health care 
      value.

TI  - A comparison of 500 prefilled textured saline breast implants versus 500 standard 
      textured saline breast implants: is there a difference in deflation rates?
PG  - 2175-8; discussion 2179-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study provides the first large-volume (1000 implant) comparison 
      of the deflation rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline 
      breast implants versus a control group of Mentor Siltex textured saline implants. 
      METHODS: A consecutive series of 500 Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured 
      saline breast implants was compared with a consecutive series of 500 Mentor 
      Siltex breast implants. Each breast implant was evaluated for a 4-year period, 
      and the annual deflation rate (number of deflations during a given year divided 
      by the total number of implants) and cumulative deflation rate (cumulative total 
      of deflations through a given year divided by the total number of implants) were 
      recorded. Statistical significance was calculated using the Fisher's exact test 
      at year 1 and the chi-square analysis at years 2 through 4. RESULTS: The 
      cumulative deflation rates of the Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was as 
      follows: year 1, 1.2 percent; year 2, 5.6 percent; year 3, 11.4 percent; and year 
      4, 15.4 percent. The cumulative deflation rates of the Mentor implants was: year 
      1, 0.2 percent; year 2, 0.6 percent; year 3, 1.6 percent; and year 4, 4.4 
      percent. At year 1, the difference between deflation rates was not statistically 
      significant (Fisher's exact test, p > 0.05). However, at year 2 (chi-square, 
      13.29; p < 0.001), year 3 (chi-square, 37.91; p < 0.001), and year 4 (chi-square, 
      32.69; p < 0.001), the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was a statistically significant difference between the overall deflation 
      rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants and 
      Mentor Siltex breast implants at year 2, year 3, and year 4. After 4 years, the 
      15.56 percent cumulative deflation rate of Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was 
      over 3.5 times higher than the 4.31 percent deflation rate of the Mentor Siltex 
      implants. There may be several factors contributing to the higher deflation rate 
      seen in Poly Implant Prosthesis implants, including possible in vitro deflation 
      before implantation and silicone shell curing technique. Nevertheless, this 
      statistically significant deflation difference must be taken into account when 
      balancing the risks and benefits of Poly Implant Prosthesis breast implants.

TI  - Is withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism based on beta-endorphin deficiency?
PG  - 433-7
AB  - RATIONALE: Associations between several psychopathological alterations and 
      lowered beta-endorphin(beta E) plasma levels have already been stated in former 
      studies. However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally 
      failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E 
      in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and 
      depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a 
      delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became 
      available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological 
      parameters. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether 
      beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, 
      and craving. METHODS: We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving 
      during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive 
      sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 
      healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the 
      pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and 
      cortisol were also determined. RESULTS: In accordance with prior studies, beta E 
      was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to 
      controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in 
      alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly 
      between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased 
      significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely 
      correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation 
      coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation 
      was largely independent from ACTH. In addition, a significant inverse 
      relationship was found between beta E and craving on day 14 (r=-0.28). No 
      association appeared between beta E and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give 
      first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to 
      anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.

TI  - Cardiac reoperations in octogenarians: Do they really benefit?
PG  - 1138-1144
LID - 10.1111/ggi.12609 [doi]
AB  - AIM: According to the demographic development of our society, the numbers of 
      octogenarians referred to cardiac surgery are continuously growing. Although the 
      benefit of first-time cardiac procedures for these patients is well documented, 
      the fate of octogenarians after redo-procedures, with special regard to long-term 
      survival, functional status and quality of life, is poorly investigated. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively identified 84 consecutive patients aged >/=80 years, who 
      underwent a cardiac reoperation at the department for Cardiothoracic Surgery in 
      the Heart & Vessel Center Bad Bevensen between January 2007 and 2013. Demographic 
      profiles as well as operative data were analyzed, and the patients were 
      prospectively followed. Patient's functional status and quality of life were 
      assessed with the Barthel Index, New York Heart Association class and the short 
      form-12 questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age of the study group (61 men, 23 
      women) was 81.9 +/- 1.9 years. Most redo-procedures were carried out after primary 
      coronary artery bypass grafting (65%), primary aortic valve replacement (21%) and 
      primary mitral valve replacement (6%). The most frequent actual surgical 
      procedures were combined coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve 
      replacement (26%), isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (19%), and isolated 
      aortic valve replacement (19%). The mean length of hospital stay was 17 +/- 15 
      days. In-hospital mortality counted for 32.1%. During follow up (29 +/- 20 months) 
      a further 19.0% of the patients died. The Barthel Index of the survivors was 
      89 +/- 17 and their mean New York Heart Association class was 2 +/- 1. A total of 93% 
      of the patients were living at home. Summary scores of physical and mental health 
      of the short form-12 questionnaire equalled those of an age- and sex-matched 
      normative population. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high perioperative mortality, results 
      document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a 
      highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not 
      be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016;

TI  - Is first-line single-agent mitoxantrone in the treatment of high-risk metastatic 
      breast cancer patients as effective as combination chemotherapy? No difference in 
      survival but higher quality of life were found in a multicenter randomized trial.
PG  - 1717-29
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer 
      draw benefit from combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling 
      high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic 
      disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the 
      combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and 
      cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until 
      complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of 
      partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. 
      Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from 
      treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to 
      progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and 
      performance status. RESULTS: After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation 
      from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with 
      mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in 
      terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to 
      response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There 
      was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified 
      Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence 
      that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: No 
      significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a 
      single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or 
      survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination 
      chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be 
      questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent 
      mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring 
      quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival.

TI  - Can clinical supervision sustain our workforce in the current healthcare 
      landscape? Findings from a Queensland study of allied health professionals.
PG  - 476-482
LID - 10.1071/AH14183 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical supervision is widely recognised as a mechanism for providing 
      professional support, professional development and clinical governance for 
      healthcare workers. There have been limited studies about the effectiveness of 
      clinical supervision for allied health and minimal studies conducted within the 
      Australian health context. The aim of the present study was to identify whether 
      clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals 
      and to identify components that contributed to effectiveness. Participants 
      completed an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through the health 
      service's intranet. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with community 
      allied health workers (n = 82) 8 months after implementation of structured 
      clinical supervision. Demographic data (age, gender), work-related history 
      (profession employment level, years of experience), and supervision practice 
      (number and length of supervision sessions) were collected through an online 
      survey. The outcome measure, clinical supervision effectiveness, was 
      operationalised using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26). 
      Data were analysed with Pearson correlation (r) and independent sample t-tests 
      (t) with significance set at 0.05 (ie the probability of significant difference 
      set at P < 0.05). RESULTS: The length of the supervision sessions (r(s) >/= 0.44), 
      the number of sessions (r(s) >/= 0.35) and the total period supervision had been 
      received (r(s) >/= 0.42) were all significantly positively correlated with the 
      MCSS-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness. Three individual 
      variables, namely 'receiving clinical supervision', 'having some choice in the 
      allocation of clinical supervisor' and 'having a completed clinical supervision 
      agreement', were also significantly associated with higher total MCSS-26 scores 
      (P(s) < 0.014). CONCLUSION: The results of the study demonstrate that when 
      clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional 
      support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational 
      change.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the predictive value of distal ureteral diameter (UD) on 
      reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary 
      vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      review of patients diagnosed with primary VUR between 2009 and 2012 who were 
      managed by endoscopic injection. Seventy preoperative and postoperative voiding 
      cystourethrograms were reviewed. The largest UD within the false pelvis was 
      measured. The UD was divided by the L1-L3 vertebral body distance to get the UD 
      ratio (UDR). One radiologist interpreted the findings of voiding 
      cystourethrography in all patients. Clinical outcome was defined as reflux 
      resolution. RESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled in this series (17 boys and 
      53 girls). Mean age was 5.9 years (1.2-13 years). Grade III presented in 37 
      patients (53%), and 33 patients (47%) were of grade IV. Mean distal UD was 5.5 mm 
      (2.5-13 mm). Mean UDR was 37.8% (18%-70%). Macroplastique injection was performed 
      in all. Subureteric injection was performed in 60 patients (86%), whereas 
      intraureteric injection was performed in 10 patients. No postoperative 
      complications were detected. The effect of grade, UD, and UDR on success after 
      endoscopic injection was tested. UD and UDR were significant predictors of reflux 
      resolution on logistic regression analysis (P <.007 and .001, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a 
      predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.

TI  - Is lumbar drainage of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula after spine 
      surgery effective?
PG  - 23-7
AB  - AIM: This study is a retrospective consecutive case series analysis of 198 
      patients who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 2010. The aim of this paper 
      was to assess the efficacy and safeness of bed rest and lumbar drainage in 
      treating postoperative CSF fistula. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      fistula is a well-known complication in spine surgery which lead to a significant 
      change in length of hospitalization and possible postoperative complications. 
      Management of CSF leaks has changed little over the past 20 years with no golden 
      standard advocated from literature. METHODS: Postoperative CSF fistulas were 
      described in 16 of 198 patients (8%) who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 
      2010. The choice of the therapeutic strategy was based on the clinical condition 
      of the patients, taking into account the possibility to maintain the prone 
      position continuously and the risk of morbidity due to prolonged bed rest. Six 
      patients were treated conservatively (position prone for three weeks), ten 
      patients were treated by positioning an external CSF lumbar drainage for ten 
      days. The mean follow-up period was ten months. RESULTS: All patients healed 
      their wound properly and no adverse events were recorded. Patients treated 
      conservatively were cured in a mean period of 30 days, while patients treated 
      with CSF drainage were cured in a mean period of 10 days. CONCLUSION: Lumbar 
      drainage seems to be effective and safe both in preventing CSF fistula in cases 
      of large dural tears and debilitated/irradiated patients and in treating CSF 
      leaks.

TI  - Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach 
      for planning knee revision surgery?
PG  - 3244-50
LID - 10.1007/s00167-014-3157-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Reconstructing the natural joint line in knee revision surgery improves 
      clinical and functional outcome but may be challenging when both cartilage and 
      bone were removed during previous operations. Assessing joint lines (JLs) by 
      means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human 
      anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that 
      JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks 
      to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. METHODS: 
      Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, 
      two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the 
      medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p 
      value of </=0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Two hundred 
      knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, 
      the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with 
      narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1. CONCLUSION: As a new 
      assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of 
      the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance 
      between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, 
      visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement 
      accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the 
      JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision 
      surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Study, Level II.

TI  - Can myometrial electrical activity identify patients in preterm labor?
PG  - 378.e1-6
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2008.08.003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether myometrial 
      electrical activity can differentiate false from true preterm labor. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Electrical uterine myography (EUM) was measured prospectively on 87 
      women, gestational age less than 35 weeks. The period between contractions, power 
      of contraction peaks and movement of center of electrical activity (RMS), was 
      used to develop an index score (1-5) for prediction of preterm delivery (PTD) 
      within 14 days of the test. The score was compared with fetal fibronectin (fFN) 
      and cervical length (CL). RESULTS: Patients delivering within 14 days from 
      testing showed a higher index and mean RMS (P = .000). No patients with EUM index 
      scores of 1-2 delivered in this time frame. Combining EUM with CL or fFN 
      increased predictability. Logistic regression revealed that history of PTD and 
      EUM index had 4- to 5-fold increased risk for PTD. Gestational age at testing, 
      body mass index, fFN, and CL were nonsignificant contributors to PTD risk. 
      CONCLUSION: Measuring myometrial electrical activity may enhance identification 
      of patients in true premature labor.

TI  - Does the Transmissible Liability Index (TLI) assessed in late childhood predict 
      suicidal symptoms at young adulthood?
PG  - 264-8
LID - 10.3109/00952990.2015.1011744 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our previous work demonstrated that the Transmissible Liability Index 
      (TLI), an instrument designed as an index of liability for substance use disorder 
      (SUD), is associated with risk of substance use disorder. This longitudinal study 
      assessed whether TLI measured in 10-12-year-olds (late childhood) predicts 
      suicidal behavior from age 12-14 (preadolescence) to age 25 (young adulthood). We 
      hypothesized that TLI would predict number and severity of suicide attempts. 
      METHODS: Subjects were sons of men who had lifetime history of SUD (n = 250), 
      called the High Average Risk (HAR) group, and sons of men with no lifetime 
      history of a SUD (n = 250), called the Low Average Risk (LAR) group. The TLI was 
      delineated at baseline (age 10-12), and age-specific versions were administered 
      at 12-14, 16, 19, 22, and 25 years of age. RESULTS: TLI was significantly 
      associated with number and severity of lifetime suicide attempts. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings confirm the hypothesis that TLI assessed at late childhood is a 
      predictor of frequency and severity of suicidal behavior from preadolescence to 
      young adulthood.

TI  - Does strategy training reduce age-related deficits in working memory?
PG  - 346-56
LID - 10.1159/000356699 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults typically perform worse on measures of working memory 
      (WM) than do young adults; however, age-related differences in WM performance 
      might be reduced if older adults use effective encoding strategies. OBJECTIVE: 
      The purpose of the current experiment was to evaluate WM performance after 
      training individuals to use effective encoding strategies. METHODS: Participants 
      in the training group (older adults: n = 39; young adults: n = 41) were taught 
      about various verbal encoding strategies and their differential effectiveness and 
      were trained to use interactive imagery and sentence generation on a 
      list-learning task. Participants in the control group (older: n = 37; young: n = 
      38) completed an equally engaging filler task. All participants completed a pre- 
      and post-training reading span task, which included self-reported strategy use, 
      as well as two transfer tasks that differed in the affordance to use the trained 
      strategies - a paired-associate recall task and the self-ordered pointing task. 
      RESULTS: Both young and older adults were able to use the target strategies on 
      the WM task and showed gains in WM performance after training. The age-related WM 
      deficit was not greatly affected, however, and the training gains did not 
      transfer to the other cognitive tasks. In fact, participants attempted to adapt 
      the trained strategies for a paired-associate recall task, but the increased 
      strategy use did not benefit their performance. CONCLUSIONS: Strategy training 
      can boost WM performance, and its benefits appear to arise from strategy-specific 
      effects and not from domain-general gains in cognitive ability.

TI  - Does the sex of acute stroke patients influence the effectiveness of rt-PA?
PG  - 60
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-14-60 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women have been reported to show more frequent recanalization and 
      better recovery after intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator 
      (rt-PA) treatment for acute stroke compared with men. To investigate this we 
      studied a series of stroke patients receiving IV rt-PA and undergoing acute 
      transcranial doppler (TCD) examination. METHODS: Acute stroke patients received 
      IV rt-PA and had acute TCD examination within 4 hours of symptom onset at 4 major 
      stroke centers. TCD findings were interpreted using the Thrombolysis in Brain 
      Ischemia (TIBI) flow grading system. The recanalization rates, and poor 3-month 
      outcomes (modified Rankin scale >2) of men and women were compared using the 
      chi-square test. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess sex as a 
      predictor of recanalization and poor 3-month outcome after controlling for age, 
      baseline NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), time to treatment, hypertension, and blood 
      glucose. RESULTS: 369 patients had TCD examinations before or during IV rt-PA 
      treatment. The 199 (53.9%) men and 170 (46.1%) women had mean ages of 67 +/- 13 and 
      70 +/- 14 years, respectively. The sexes did not differ significantly in baseline 
      stroke severity, time to TCD examination, or time to thrombolysis. Of the men, 68 
      (34.2%) had complete recanalization, 58 (29.1%) had partial recanalization, and 
      73 (36.6%) had no recanalization. Of the women, 53 (31.2%) had complete 
      recanalization, 46 (27%) had partial recanalization, and 71 (41.8%) had no 
      recanalization (p = 0.6). Multiple regression analyses showed no difference 
      between the sexes in recanalization rate, time to recanalization, or clinical 
      outcome at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: In our study; sex is not a significant 
      predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in 
      stroke patients following IV rt-PA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Data from CLOTBUST trial

TI  - Does the early adopter of drugs exist? A population-based study of general 
      practitioners' prescribing of new drugs.
PG  - 667-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse associations between indicators for adoption of new drugs 
      and to test the hypothesis that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a 
      personal trait independent of drug groups. METHODS: In a population-based cohort 
      study using register data, we analysed the prescribing of new drugs by Danish 
      general practitioners. Angiotensin-II antagonists, triptans, selective 
      cyclo-oxygenase-2 antagonists and esomeprazol were used in the assessment. As 
      indicators of new drug uptake, we used adoption time, cumulative incidence, 
      preference proportion, incidence rate and prescription cost and volume. For each 
      measure, we ranked the general practices. Ranks were pair-wise plotted, and 
      Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r) was calculated. Next, we analysed the 
      correlation between ranks across different drug classes. RESULTS: For all 
      indicators, the general practitioners' adoption of one group of drugs was poorly 
      associated with adoption of others ( r</=0.49), indicating that early adoption of 
      one type of drugs is not associated with early adoption of another. For all drug 
      groups, adoption time adjusted for practice size was only weakly associated with 
      other indicators ( r: -0.56 to -0.27). Indicators, based on cost and volume of 
      drugs, were highly correlated ( r: 0.96-0.99), and the others correlated 
      reasonably well ( r: 0.51-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Within drug groups, indicators of 
      drug adoption, except for adoption time, correlate reasonably well. However, the 
      theory that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait 
      independent of the type of drug could not be confirmed. The notion of the 
      early-drug-adopting general practitioner may be mistaken.

AB  - AIM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission via nonsexual modes in childhood has 
      been proposed by several researchers. The aim of our study was to determine the 
      presence of 'high-risk' HPV DNA in human breast milk. METHODS: Using polymerase 
      chain reaction techniques, we evaluated the presence of HPV infection in human 
      breast milk collected from 21 HPV-positive and 11 HPV-negative mothers. RESULTS: 
      Of the 32 studied human milk specimens, no 'high-risk' HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 
      39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 or 58 DNA was detected. CONCLUSION: This preliminary 
      case-control study indicates the absence of mucosal 'high-risk' HPV types in 
      human breast milk.

TI  - Is nasogastric decompression useful in prevention of leaks after laparoscopic 
      sleeve gastrectomy? A randomized trial.
PG  - 234-9
LID - 10.3109/08941939.2013.875606 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although its excellent results, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 
      (LSG) presents major complications ranging from 0% to 29%. Among them, the staple 
      line leak presents an incidence varying from 0% to 7%. Many trials debated about 
      different solutions in order to reduce leaks' incidence. No author has 
      investigated the role of gastric decompression in the prevention of this 
      complication. Aim of our work is to evaluate if this procedure can play a role in 
      avoiding the occurrence of staple line leaks after LSG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Between January 2008 and November 2012, 145 patients were prospectively and 
      randomly included in the study. Seventy patients composed the group A, whose 
      operations were completed with placement of nasogastric tube; the other 75 
      patients were included in the group B, in which no nasogastric tube was placed. 
      RESULTS: No statistical differences were observed between group A and group B 
      regarding gender distribution, age, weight, and BMI. No intraoperative 
      complications and no conversion occurred in both groups. Intraoperative blood 
      loss (50.1 +/- 42.3 vs. 52.5 +/- 37.6 ml, respectively) and operative time (65.4 +/- 
      25.5 vs. 62.6 +/- 27.8 min, respectively) were comparable between the two groups 
      (p: NS). One staple line leak (1.4%) occurred on 6th postoperative day in group A 
      patients. No leak was observed in group B patients. Postoperative hospital stay 
      was significantly longer in group A vs. group B patients (7.6 +/- 3.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 3.1 
      days, respectively, p: 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Routine placement of nasogastric tube 
      in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.

TI  - Regional anesthesia as compared with general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric 
      patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health 
      care costs? Results of a single-centered study.
PG  - 948-56
LID - 10.1111/j.1526-4637.2012.01402.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture in geriatric patients has a substantial economic 
      impact and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this 
      population. At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for 
      patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review 
      examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs 
      general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and 
      hospitalization costs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved data 
      collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery 
      for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative 
      morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from 
      data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients 
      received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During 
      July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia 
      and analgesia program was introduced. RESULTS: The average cost of 
      hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no 
      different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 
      631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive 
      care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. 
      Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with 
      increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission 
      are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, 
      in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing 
      regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery 
      beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.

TI  - Double reading of barium enemas: is it necessary?
PG  - 1607-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine the effectiveness, clinical 
      impact, and feasibility of double reading barium enemas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Independent double readings of 1,003 consecutive barium enemas (822 double- and 
      181 single-contrast examinations) were prospectively performed. From this pool of 
      1,003 examinations, 994 were included in our study. Examinations showing at least 
      one polyp or carcinoma 5 mm or larger were considered to have positive results. 
      For combined readings, results were considered positive if either of the two 
      interpreters reported finding a polyp or carcinoma. A McNemar test was used to 
      compare the first reader's results with the combined results of the first and 
      second readers. Results were retrospectively correlated with endoscopic or 
      surgical results in 360 patients, and agreement between first and combined 
      readings and endoscopic results was determined. RESULTS: Adding a second reader 
      increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315 (p < 
      0.0001) and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients 
      (9.9%). Sensitivity of the first and combined readings for detection of all 
      lesions was identical, 76.3% (95% CI, 65.4-87.1%). Specificity decreased from 
      91.0% (95% CI, 87.9-94.3%) for the first reading to 86.4% (95% CI, 82.2-90.0%) 
      for the combined reading. The overall measurement of agreement decreased from a 
      kappa value of 61.8 (95% CI, 51.2-72.4%) for the first reading to 52.9 (95% CI, 
      42.2-63.6%) for the combined reading. The second reading required an average of 
      3.3 min. Sensitivity for the detection of adenocarcinomas was 100%. CONCLUSION: 
      Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity 
      for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.

TI  - Is there any evidence of a "July effect" in patients undergoing major cancer 
      surgery?
PG  - 82-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The "July effect" refers to the phenomenon of adverse impacts on 
      patient care arising from the changeover in medical staff that takes place during 
      this month at academic medical centres in North America. There has been some 
      evidence supporting the presence of the July effect, including data from surgical 
      specialties. Uniformity of care, regardless of time of year, is required for 
      patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We therefore sought to perform a 
      population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. 
      METHODS: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients 
      undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 
      1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative 
      complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently 
      multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were 
      performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of 
      outcome after major cancer surgery. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, the overall 
      postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic 
      complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. 
      However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were 
      significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative 
      complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered 
      separately or together. CONCLUSION: On the whole, the data confirm an absence of 
      a July effect in patients undergoing major cancer surgery.

TI  - Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are 
      hormonal differences responsible?
PG  - 1838-45
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181760c14 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the gender dimorphism after injury with specific 
      reference to the reproductive age of the women (young, <48 yrs of age, vs. old, 
      >52 yrs of age) in a cohort of severely injured trauma patients for which 
      significant variation in postinjury care is minimized. DESIGN: Secondary data 
      analysis of an ongoing prospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Academic, 
      level I trauma and intensive care unit centers. PATIENTS: Blunt-injured adults 
      with hemorrhagic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      Separate Cox proportional hazard regression models were formulated based on all 
      patients to evaluate the effects of gender on mortality, multiple organ failure, 
      and nosocomial infection, after controlling for all important confounders. These 
      models were then used to characterize the effect of gender in young and old age 
      groups. Overall mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection rates 
      for the entire cohort (n = 1,036) were 20%, 40%, and 45%, respectively. Mean 
      Injury Severity Score was 32 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD). Men (n = 680) and women (n = 
      356) were clinically similar except that men required higher crystalloid volumes, 
      more often had a history of alcoholism and liver disease, and had greater 
      ventilatory and intensive care unit requirements. Female gender was independently 
      associated with a 43% and 23% lower risk of multiple organ failure and nosocomial 
      infection, respectively. Gender remained an independent risk factor in young and 
      old subgroup analysis, with the protection afforded by female gender remaining 
      unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The independent protective effect of female gender on 
      multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection rates remains significant in both 
      premenopausal and postmenopausal women when compared with similarly aged men. 
      This is contrary to previous experimental studies and the known physiologic sex 
      hormone changes that occur after menopause in women. These results suggest that 
      factors other than sex hormones may be responsible for gender-based differences 
      after injury.

TI  - Cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction in elderly patients: 
      does admission to a tertiary center improve survival?
PG  - 768-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of early revascularization among patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock remains controversial. 
      Angioplasty registries, while suggesting a benefit, are subject to selection 
      bias, and clinical trials have been underpowered to detect early benefits. If an 
      invasive strategy is beneficial in this population, patients admitted to 
      hospitals with onsite coronary revascularization might be expected to have a 
      better prognosis. We sought to determine whether access to cardiovascular 
      resources at the admitting hospital influenced the prognosis of patients with 
      acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. METHODS: By use of 
      the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project database (a retrospective medical record 
      review of Medicare patients discharged with acute myocardial infarction), we 
      identified patients aged > or =65 years whose myocardial infarction was 
      complicated by cardiogenic shock. RESULTS: Of the 601 patients with cardiogenic 
      shock, 287 (47.8%) were admitted to hospitals without revascularization services 
      and 314 (52.2%) were admitted to hospitals with coronary angioplasty and coronary 
      artery bypass surgery facilities. Clinical characteristics were similar across 
      the subgroups. Patients admitted to hospitals with revascularization services 
      were more likely to undergo coronary revascularization during the index 
      hospitalization and during the first month after acute myocardial infarction. 
      After adjustment for demographic, clinical, hospital, and treatment strategies, 
      the presence of onsite revascularization services was not associated with a 
      significantly lower 30-day (odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.47, 1.45) or 1-year 
      mortality (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.49, 1.72). CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based 
      cohort, patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic 
      shock did not have significantly different adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality, 
      irrespective of the revascularization capabilities of the admitting hospital.

TI  - Sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma: is it clinically 
      meaningful?
PG  - 729-35
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to identify prognostic factors for the survival 
      of children with cerebellar astrocytoma, and to evaluate the reproducibility and 
      prognostic value of histological sub-classification and grading. METHODS: 
      Children aged 0-14 years treated in Denmark for a cerebellar astrocytoma in the 
      period 1960-1984 were included and followed until January 2001 or until their 
      death. The histological specimens from each patient were reviewed for revised 
      grading and classification according to three different classification schemes: 
      the WHO, the Kernohan and the Daumas-Duport grading systems. RESULTS: The overall 
      survival rate was 81% after a follow-up time of 15-40 years. The significant 
      positive prognostic factors for survival were "surgically gross-total removal" of 
      the tumour at surgery and location of the tumour in the cerebellum proper as 
      opposed to location in the fourth ventricle. No difference in survival time was 
      demonstrated when we compared pilocytic astrocytoma and fibrillary astrocytoma. 
      Moreover, we found that the Kernohan and the WHO classification systems had no 
      predictive value and that the Daumas-Duport system is unsuitable as a prognostic 
      tool for low-grade posterior fossa astrocytomas. CONCLUSION: Discordant 
      observations due to interobserver variability make histological 
      sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas in children insufficient 
      for predicting prognosis and biological behaviour. Similar survival rates in a 
      population of paediatric low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas of grades I and II 
      indicate that tumour grade has no prognostic significance within this group of 
      patients. "Surgically gross-total removal", especially if the tumour is located 
      in the fourth ventricle is of the highest importance for long-term survival. 
      Histological sub-classification of the tumours has no predictive value.

TI  - Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions 
      and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree?
PG  - 327-32
LID - 10.1080/15389588.2011.581716 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research on stroke survivors' driving safety has typically used either 
      self-reports or government records, but the extent to which the 2 may differ is 
      not known. We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle 
      collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. METHODS: The 
      56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and 
      community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of 
      moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who 
      had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 
      participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were 
      acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario 
      (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a 
      semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. RESULTS: 
      Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did 
      not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the 
      MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa 
      coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for 
      collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). 
      When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up 
      to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 
      years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone. 
      CONCLUSION: In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle 
      collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future 
      studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more 
      accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.

TI  - Cholesterol screening in school children: is family history reliable to choose 
      the ones to screen?
PG  - 1794-8
AB  - AIM: Hyperlipidemia is a major factor accompanying atherosclerosis. As the basis 
      of atherosclerotic heart disease begins at early childhood, we aim to find out 
      which children should be tested for hypercholesterolemia, what the high 
      cholesterol level in children is and what cautions should be taken to avoid 
      atherosclerosis. METHODS: The study was carried on 2096 school children (1043 
      male, 1053 female) in Ankara. Their mean age was 9.03 years. Demographic 
      properties of the study group and their families were determined and the serum 
      lipid levels of the subjects were obtained. The relation between these 
      demographic properties and lipid levels were investigated. RESULTS: In 135 of the 
      subjects' serum cholesterol level was >or=200 mg/dL and in 83 subjects serum 
      LDL-cholesterol level was >or=130 mg/dL. Despite 64.4% of the subjects reported a 
      family history of hyperlipidemia, no relations between family history and serum 
      lipid levels were found. CONCLUSION: We suggest that regardless of family 
      history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. 
      Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be 
      given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children 
      is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of 
      children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polio eradication is now feasible after removal of Nigeria from the 
      list of endemic countries and global reduction of cases of wild polio virus in 
      2015 by more than 80%. However, all countries must remain focused to achieve 
      eradication. In August 2015, the Catholic bishops in Kenya called for boycott of 
      a polio vaccination campaign citing safety concerns with the polio vaccine. We 
      conducted a survey to establish if the coverage was affected by the boycott. 
      METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted in all the 32 counties that 
      participated in the campaign. A total of 90,157 children and 37,732 
      parents/guardians were sampled to determine the vaccination coverage and reasons 
      for missed vaccination. RESULTS: The national vaccination coverage was 93% 
      compared to 94% in the November 2014 campaign. The proportion of 
      parents/guardians that belonged to Catholic Church was 31% compared to 7% of the 
      children who were missed. Reasons for missed vaccination included house not being 
      visited (44%), children not being at home at time of visit (38%), refusal by 
      parents (12%), children being as leep (1%), and various other reasons (5%). 
      Compared to the November 2014 campaign, the proportion of children who were not 
      vaccinated due to parent's refusal significantly increased from 6% to 12% in 
      August 2015. CONCLUSION: The call for boycott did not affect the campaign 
      significantly. However, if the call for boycott is repeated in future it could 
      have some significant negative implication to polio eradication. It is therefore 
      important to ensure that any vaccine safety issues are addressed accordingly.

TI  - Does early discharge with nurse home visits affect adequacy of newborn metabolic 
      screening?
PG  - 213-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of early discharge on newborn metabolic 
      screening. STUDY DESIGN: Metabolic screening results were obtained from the 
      Alabama State Lab for all infants born at our hospital between 8/1/97, and 
      1/31/99, and were matched with an existing database of early discharge infants. 
      An early newborn discharge was defined as a discharge between 24 and 47 hours of 
      age. Metabolic screening tests included phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, 
      and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Early discharge and traditional stay 
      infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the 
      timing of the first adequate specimen. RESULTS: The state laboratory received 
      specimens from 3860 infants; 1324 were on early discharge newborns and 2536 
      infants in the traditional stay group. At least one filter paper test (PKU, 
      hypothyroidism, and CAH) was collected on 99.2% of early discharge infants and 
      96.0% of traditional stay infants (P<.0001). Early discharge infants had a higher 
      rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared with 
      traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001) but had a higher rate of repeat 
      specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 
      75.3% traditional stay, P=.002). The early discharge group was more likely to 
      have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life (1001, 98.8% early 
      discharge vs 2016, 96.7% traditional stay, P=.0005). CONCLUSIONS: In this well 
      established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic 
      screening is not compromised by early discharge.

TI  - Is alexithymia a risk factor for unexplained physical symptoms in general medical 
      outpatients?
PG  - 768-78
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alexithymia is presumed to play an important predisposing role in the 
      pathogenesis of medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, no research on 
      alexithymia has been done among general medical outpatients who present with 
      medically unexplained physical symptoms as their main problem and in which 
      anxiety and depression have been considered as possible confounding factors. This 
      study investigated whether patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms 
      are more alexithymic than those with explained symptoms and whether, in patients 
      with unexplained symptoms, alexithymia is associated with subjective health 
      experience and use of medical services. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional 
      study among patients attending an internal medicine outpatient clinic. All 
      patients were given a standardized interview and completed a number of 
      questionnaires. RESULTS: After complete physical examinations, 169 of 321 
      patients had unexplained physical symptoms according to two independent raters. 
      Patients with medically unexplained symptoms more often had a mental disorder, 
      but overall they were not more alexithymic. In patients with unexplained physical 
      symptoms, alexithymia was not associated with subjective health experience or use 
      of medical services. However, patients with both unexplained symptoms and a 
      mental disorder who also denied any possible connection between emotional 
      problems and their physical symptoms did have more alexithymic traits. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients with medically unexplained physical 
      symptoms, alexithymia does not play a role of clinical significance. Patients 
      with unexplained physical symptoms are heterogeneous with respect to psychiatric 
      syndrome pathology and probably also with respect to personality pathology.

      athletes?
PG  - E23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the evidence base of sports medicine research and assess 
      how relevant and applicable it is to everyday practice. METHODS: Original 
      research articles, short reports, and case reports published in four major sport 
      and exercise medicine journals were studied and classified according to the main 
      topic of study and type of subjects used. RESULTS: The most common topic was 
      sports science, and very few studies related to the treatment of injuries and 
      medical conditions. The majority of published articles used healthy subjects 
      sampled from the sedentary population, and few studies have been carried out on 
      injured participants. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of studies addressing 
      diagnostic and treatment interventions in the sports medicine literature. The 
      evidence base for sports medicine must continue to increase in terms of volume 
      and quality.

TI  - Does quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion change after fibrous 
      tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis?
PG  - 17-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared left ventricular regional wall motion, the global left 
      ventricular ejection fraction, and the New York Heart Association functional 
      class pre- and postoperatively. INTRODUCTION: Endomyocardial fibrosis is 
      characterized by fibrous tissue deposition in the endomyocardium of the apex 
      and/or inflow tract of one or both ventricles. Although left ventricular global 
      systolic function is preserved, patients exhibit wall motion abnormalities in the 
      apical and inferoapical regions. Fibrous tissue resection in New York Heart 
      Association FC III and IV endomyocardial fibrosis patients has been shown to 
      decrease morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We prospectively studied 30 patients 
      (20 female, 30+/-10 years) before and 5+/-8 months after surgery. The left 
      ventricular ejection fraction was determined using the area-length method. 
      Regional left ventricular motion was measured by the centerline method. Five left 
      ventricular segments were analyzed pre- and postoperatively. Abnormality was 
      expressed in units of standard deviation from the mean motion in a normal 
      reference population. RESULTS: Left ventricular wall motion in the five regions 
      did not differ between pre- and postoperative measurements. Additionally, the 
      left ventricular ejection fraction did not change after surgery (0.45+/-0.13% x 
      0.43+/-0.12% pre- and postoperatively, respectively). The New York Heart 
      Association functional class improved to class I in 40% and class II in 43% of 
      patients postoperatively (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although endomyocardial fibrosis 
      patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left 
      ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not 
      change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in 
      diastolic function, may be operational.

      birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian 
      Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the 
      US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential 
      misclassification of gestational age. METHODS: Simulation was used to measure the 
      potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported 
      gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection 
      (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by 
      assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the 
      reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help 
      specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations. RESULTS: At full 
      term, the parameters of the birthweight distributions were robust to gestational 
      age misclassification. At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to 
      misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor 
      misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the 
      divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported 
      divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might 
      help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.

TI  - Utility of unenhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted MRI in children with sickle cell 
      disease -- can it differentiate bone infarcts from acute osteomyelitis?
PG  - 1981-7
LID - 10.1007/s00247-015-3423-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of bone infarcts 
      and acute osteomyelitis. The clinical differentiation between a bone infarct and 
      acute osteomyelitis is a diagnostic challenge. Unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MR 
      images have been proposed as a potential tool to differentiate bone infarcts from 
      osteomyelitis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability of unenhanced T1-W 
      fat-saturated MRI for differentiation between bone infarcts and acute 
      osteomyelitis in children with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively 
      reviewed the records of 31 children (20 boys, 11 girls; mean age 10.6 years, 
      range 1.1-17.9 years) with SCD and acute bone pain who underwent MR imaging 
      including unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated images from 2005 to 2010. Complete 
      clinical charts were reviewed by a pediatric hematologist with training in 
      infectious diseases to determine a clinical standard to define the presence or 
      absence of osteomyelitis. A pediatric radiologist reviewed all MR imaging and was 
      blinded to clinical information. Based on the signal intensity in T1-W 
      fat-saturated images, the children were further classified as positive for 
      osteomyelitis (low bone marrow signal intensity) or positive for bone infarct 
      (high bone marrow signal intensity). RESULTS: Based on the clinical standard, 5 
      children were classified as positive for osteomyelitis and 26 children as 
      positive for bone infarct (negative for osteomyelitis). The bone marrow signal 
      intensity on T1-W fat-saturated imaging was not significant for the 
      differentiation between bone infarct and osteomyelitis (P = 0.56). None of the 
      additional evaluated imaging parameters on unenhanced MRI proved reliable in 
      differentiating these diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The bone marrow signal intensity on 
      unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MR images is not a reliable criterion to 
      differentiate bone infarcts from osteomyelitis in children.

TI  - Do African American women require fewer calories to maintain weight?: Results 
      from a controlled feeding trial.
PG  - 561-7
LID - 10.1177/0884533612445072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of obesity in African American (AA) women may 
      result, in part, from a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) than non-AA women. If 
      true, AA women should require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain 
      weight. Our objective was to determine in the setting of a controlled feeding 
      study, if AA women required fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis includes 206 women (73% AA), aged 22-75 
      years, who participated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) 
      trial-a multicenter, randomized, controlled, feeding study comparing the effects 
      of 3 dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or 
      stage 1 hypertension. After a 3-week run-in, participants were randomized to 1 of 
      3 dietary patterns for 8 weeks. Calorie intake was adjusted during feeding to 
      maintain stable weight. The primary outcome of this analysis was average daily 
      calorie (kcal) intake during feeding. RESULTS: AA women had higher baseline 
      weight and body mass index than non-AA women (78.4 vs 72.4 kg, P < .01; 29.0 vs 
      27.6 kg/m(2), P < .05, respectively). During intervention feeding, mean (SD) kcal 
      was 2168 (293) in AA women and 2073 (284) in non-AA women. Mean intake was 94.7 
      kcal higher in AA women than in non-AA women (P < .05). After adjustment for 
      potential confounders, there was no difference in caloric intake between AA and 
      non-AA women (Delta = -2.8 kcal, P = .95). CONCLUSION: These results do not support 
      the view that AA women are at greater risk for obesity because they require fewer 
      calories to maintain weight.

TI  - The use of audit to identify maternal mortality in different settings: is it just 
      a difference between the rich and the poor?
PG  - 133-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To illustrate how maternal mortality audit identifies different causes 
      of and contributing factors to maternal deaths in different settings in low- and 
      high-income countries and how this can lead to local solutions in reducing 
      maternal deaths. DESIGN: Descriptive study of maternal mortality from different 
      settings and review of data on the history of reducing maternal mortality in what 
      are now high-income countries. SETTINGS: Kalabo district in Zambia, Farafenni 
      division in The Gambia, Onandjokwe district in Namibia, and the Netherlands. 
      POPULATION: Population of rural areas in Zambia and The Gambia, peri-urban 
      population in Namibia and nationwide data from The Netherlands. METHODS: Data 
      from facility-based maternal mortality audits from three African hospitals and 
      data from the latest confidential enquiry in The Netherlands. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Maternal mortality ratio (MMR), causes (direct and indirect) and 
      characteristics. RESULTS: MMR ranged from 10 per 100,000 (the Netherlands) to 
      1540 per 100,000 (The Gambia). Differences in causes of deaths were characterized 
      by HIV/AIDS in Namibia, sepsis and HIV/AIDS in Zambia, (pre-)eclampsia in the 
      Netherlands and obstructed labour in The Gambia. CONCLUSION: Differences in 
      maternal mortality are more than just differences between the rich and poor. 
      Acknowledging the magnitude of maternal mortality and harnessing a strong 
      political will to tackle the issues are important factors. However, there is no 
      single, general solution to reduce maternal mortality, and identification of 
      problems needs to be promoted through audit, both national and local.

TI  - Are wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation equivalent?
PG  - 293-9
LID - 10.1097/JGP.0b013e3181629943 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined equivalence of wandering and physically 
      nonaggressive agitation (PNA) as concepts. DESIGN: A cross-sectional 
      correlational design was used. SETTING: Participants were recruited from 22 
      nursing homes and 6 assisted living facilities in two states. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Ambulatory residents meeting DSM-IV criteria for dementia (N = 181) were studied. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Video-tapes for up to twelve 20-minute observations per participant 
      were coded for wandering using an empirically derived taxonomy of ambulation 
      patterns. Separate raters coded the same tapes for six PNA behaviors on the 
      agitation behavior mapping instrument. RESULTS: Most participants (73.5%) 
      wandered; all showed PNA behaviors. Factor analyses yielded an one-factor 
      solution for wandering (explained variance = 43.66%) and a two-factor solution 
      for PNA (explained variance = 53.45%). Overall wandering correlated significantly 
      with PNA Factor 1 (df =179, r = 0.68, p <0.001) and Factor 2, but at a lower 
      value (df = 179, r = 0.26, p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Findings depict wandering and 
      PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct 
      validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have 
      implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of 
      wandering and agitation.

TI  - Is the covering of the resection margin after distal pancreatectomy advantageous?
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/2047-783X-18-33 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, many advances in pancreatic surgery have been 
      achieved. Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail 
      resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in 
      prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results 
      concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal 
      pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of 
      patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal 
      pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. 
      Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or 
      interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare 
      the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the 
      resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage 
      of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using 
      Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Main indications for pancreatic 
      surgery were insulinoma (n=18, 24%), ductal adenocarcinoma (n=9, 12%), 
      non-single-insulinoma-pancreatogenic-hypoglycemia-syndrome (NSIPHS) (n=8, 11%), 
      and pancreatic cysts with pancreatitis (n=8, 11%). In 39 of 74 (53%) patients no 
      postoperative complications were noted. In detail we found that 23/42 (55%) 
      patients with coverage vs. 16/32 (50%) without coverage of the resection margins 
      had no postoperative complications. The most common complications were pancreatic 
      fistulas in eleven patients (15%), and postoperative bleeding in nine patients 
      (12%). Pancreatic fistulas occurred in patients without coverage of the resection 
      margins in 7/32 (22%) vs. 4/42 (1011%) with coverage are of the resection 
      margins, yet without reaching statistical significance. Postoperative bleeding 
      ensued with equal frequency in both groups (12% with coverage versus 13% without 
      coverage of the resection margins). The reoperation rate was 8%. The hospital 
      stay for patients without coverage was 13 days (5-60) vs. 17 days (8-60) for 
      patients with coverage. CONCLUSIONS: The results show no significant difference 
      in the fistula rate after covering of the resection margin after distal 
      pancreatectomy, which contributes to the picture of an unsolved problem.

TI  - Does continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine impair 
      uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes?
PG  - 206-11
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bolus intravenous injection of epinephrine can 
      decrease uterine blood flow. This study examined the effects of intravenous 
      infusion of epinephrine on uterine blood flow in the gravid ewe. METHODS: 
      Maternal and fetal vascular catheters and a maternal electromagnetic uterine 
      artery flow probe were implanted in 10 near-term gravid ewes. After recovery, 
      saline, 0.125% bupivacaine, 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, 0.125% 
      bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine, and 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:800,000 
      epinephrine were infused into the maternal superior vena cava. Drugs were infused 
      at 10 mL/h for 30 minutes and then at 20 mL/h for an additional 30 minutes. 
      Animals also received an intravenous bolus of epinephrine 15 micrograms. 
      Throughout all infusions, maternal heart rate, systemic and pulmonary blood 
      pressures, uterine blood flow, cardiac output, and acid-base balance were 
      measured, as well as fetal heart rate, blood pressure, and acid-base balance. 
      RESULTS: Epinephrine 15 micrograms decreased uterine blood flow to 68 +/- 14% of 
      baseline (mean +/- SD). Infusion of all solutions had no effect on any measured 
      hemodynamic variable. CONCLUSIONS: In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of < or = 
      1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine 
      blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these 
      results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local 
      anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel 
      during the infusion.

TI  - Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources?
PG  - 243
LID - 10.1186/s12913-017-2185-4 [doi]
LID - 243
AB  - BACKGROUND: Governments are urged to determine methods to control the use of 
      medical resources and curb the rise of healthcare costs. The question is, do 
      health behaviors have an impact on the use of medical resources? This study aims 
      to identify and understand the difference in the number of outpatient visits and 
      health examinations based on various health behaviors and to determine whether 
      patients seek medical care for illness from the same physicians. METHODS: This 
      study used the dataset derived from the Department of Budget, Accounting and 
      Statistics of Kaohsiung, Taiwan in 2005. Persons older than 15 years were 
      surveyed using an on-site questionnaire. A total of 2911 persons were enrolled in 
      this study. Independent t-tests, chi-square tests, one-way ANOVA, multiple linear 
      regression and binominal logistic regression were used in the data analysis. 
      RESULTS: The regression model for the frequency of doctor visits, health 
      examinations, and whether the same physician is sought for medical care has 
      demonstrated significant correlations with gender, age and education-level 
      variables. Four health behaviors (i.e., exercise habits, dietary habits, regular 
      blood pressure measurement, drinking habits) exhibited a significant correlation 
      with healthcare utilization (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy lifestyles lead to an 
      increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not 
      much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health 
      behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their 
      blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient 
      visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation 
      services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of 
      maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

TI  - Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity?
PG  - 763-71
LID - 10.1017/S0033291708004078 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death and has been strongly associated 
      with affective disorders. The influence of affective disorder polarity on 
      subsequent suicide attempts or completions and any differential effect of suicide 
      risk factors by polarity were assessed in a prospective cohort. METHOD: 
      Participants with major affective disorders in the National Institute of Mental 
      Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study (CDS) were followed prospectively 
      for up to 25 years. A total of 909 participants meeting prospective diagnostic 
      criteria for major depressive and bipolar disorders were followed through 4204 
      mood cycles. Suicidal behavior was defined as suicide attempts or completions. 
      Mixed-effects, grouped-time survival analysis assessed risk of suicidal behavior 
      and differential effects of risk factors for suicidal behavior by polarity. In 
      addition to polarity, the main effects of age, gender, hopelessness, married 
      status, prior suicide attempts and active substance abuse were modeled, with mood 
      cycle as the unit of analysis. RESULTS: After controlling for age of onset, there 
      were no differences in prior suicide attempts by polarity although bipolar 
      participants had more prior severe attempts. During follow-up, 40 cycles ended in 
      suicide and 384 cycles contained at least one suicide attempt. Age, hopelessness 
      and active substance abuse but not polarity predicted suicidal behavior. The 
      effects of risk factors did not differ by polarity. CONCLUSIONS: Bipolarity does 
      not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of 
      well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk 
      assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without 
      regard to mood polarity.

TI  - Thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients: does prophylaxis in all 
      patients make sense?
PG  - 171-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies on thrombosis prophylaxis focus on postoperative venous 
      thrombosis. In medical wards thrombosis prophylaxis is generally restricted to 
      patients who are immobilised. Our primary aim was to investigate the incidence of 
      venous thrombosis in a general internal ward, to assess whether more rigorous 
      prophylaxis would be feasible. METHODS: We investigated the incidence of venous 
      thrombosis in patients hospitalised from 1992 to 1996 and related our findings to 
      literature reports. RESULTS: The incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis in 
      internal patients during hospitalisation was 39/6332 (0.6%). Among these 39 
      patients, 24 had a malignancy, whereas 876 out of all 6332 patients had a known 
      malignancy. So, the incidence in this group with cancer was 2.7% compared with 
      0.3% (15/5456) in the non-cancer group (relative risk for venous thrombosis due 
      to malignancy was 10.0 (95%C.I. 5.3-18.9). CONCLUSION: The incidence of venous 
      thrombosis during hospitalisation in a department of general internal medicine is 
      low and does not justify prophylaxis in all internal patients. Cancer is a strong 
      risk factor for hospital-acquired thrombosis in the medical ward. Further studies 
      may answer the question as to whether thrombosis prophylaxis in this subgroup is 
      feasible.

TI  - Is late-night salivary cortisol a better screening test for possible cortisol 
      excess than standard screening tests in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes?
PG  - 47-58
AB  - AIM: To compare the performance, in terms of specificity for cortisol excess, of 
      late-night salivary cortisol with 24-hour urine-free cortisol (24hr UFC) and 
      overnight 1mg dexamethasone suppression test (1mg DST) in a group of obese T2DM 
      patients. METHODS: Forty obese patients with T2DM without clinical features of 
      Cushing's syndrome were recruited. Plasma, urinary and salivary cortisol were 
      measured directly by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal 
      antibodies. The specificities of the three tests using various cutoffs were 
      calculated and compared, employing the assumption that none of the patients had 
      hypercortisolism. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age and BMI of 56 years (range 
      31-75) and 37 kg/m(2) (31-56) respectively. All 40 provided late-night salivary 
      cortisol samples. Thirty-eight patients completed all three tests. Two patients 
      only completed two screening tests. The specificities of late-night salivary 
      cortisol (cutoff 10 nmol/L), 24hr UFC (400 nmol) and 1mg DST (50 nmol/L) were 70% 
      (95% CI 53-83%), 90% (76-97%) and 72% (55-85%) respectively. The specificity of 
      late-night salivary cortisol was significantly less than 24 hr UFC (P=0.039) but 
      not 1mg DST (P>0.99). CONCLUSION: Late-night salivary cortisol has a poor 
      specificity for cortisol excess in obese patients with T2DM with 24 hr UFC 
      showing significantly better specificity in our population.

TI  - Does escalation of the apical dose change treatment outcome in beta-radiation of 
      posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques?
PG  - 1360-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To show the results of treating posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru 
      plaque beta-ray radiotherapy and to review and discuss the literature concerning 
      the optimal apical dose prescription (100 vs. 160 Gy). METHODS AND MATERIALS: 
      Forty-eight patients with uveal melanomas (median height 3.85 mm + 1 mm sclera) 
      were treated with ruthenium plaques. The median apical dose was 120 Gy, the 
      median scleral dose 546 Gy. RESULTS: After 5.8 years of follow-up, the overall 
      5-year survival rate was 90%, the disease specific 5-year survival rate was 92% 
      (3 patients alive with metastasis). Six percent received a second ruthenium 
      application, 10% of the eyes had to be enucleated. Local control was achieved in 
      90% of the patients with conservative therapy alone. Central or paracentral 
      tumors showed 50% of the pretherapeutic vision after 4 years, and 80% of the 
      vision was preserved in those with peripheral tumors. The main side effects were 
      mostly an uncomplicated retinopathy (30%); macular degeneration or scarring led 
      to poor central vision in 30% of cases. CONCLUSION: Brachytherapy with ruthenium 
      applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal 
      melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does 
      not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An 
      internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is 
      needed.

TI  - Estradiol and Antagonist Pretreatment Prior to Microdose Leuprolide in in Vitro 
      Fertilization. Does It Improve IVF Outcomes in Poor Responders as Compared to 
      Oral Contraceptive Pill?
PG  - 199-204
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in low responders 
      stimulated with microdose leuprolide protocol (ML) following pretreatment with 
      either oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or luteal estradiol (E2) + GnRH antagonist 
      (E2 + antag) for follicular synchronization prior to controlled ovarian 
      hyperstimulation (COH). STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of 130 
      women, who were poor responders, undergoing IVF with either OCP/ML or E2+ 
      antag/ML protocols. The main outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rates, 
      number of oocytes retrieved, and cancellation rate. RESULTS: Both groups were 
      similar in baseline characteristics. There were no significant differences in 
      gonadotropin requirement, cancellation rate, and number of embryos transferred. 
      Ongoing pregnancy rates (40% vs. 15%) were significantly higher in the OCP/ML 
      group. Trends toward greater number of oocytes retrieved (7.7 +/- 3.4 vs. 5.9 +/- 
      4.2) and improved implantation rates (20% vs. 12%) were also noted, but these did 
      not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: E2+antag pretreatment does not 
      appear to improve IVF outcomes in ML protocol when compared to the standard OCP 
      in poor responders. Randomized trials with adequate power to study the optimal 
      method of steroid pretreatments appear justified.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current risk assessment models for surgical site occurrence (SSO) 
      and surgical site infection (SSI) after open ventral hernia repair (VHR) have 
      limited external validation. Our aim was to determine (1) whether existing models 
      stratify patients into groups by risk and (2) which model best predicts the rate 
      of SSO and SSI. METHODS: Patients who underwent open VHR and were followed for at 
      least 1 mo were included. Using two data sets-a retrospective multicenter 
      database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative) and a single-center prospective 
      database (Prospective)-each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of 
      the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working 
      Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wound Class, and Hernia 
      Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were 
      also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National 
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared to 
      assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's 
      chi-square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients 
      into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI. RESULTS: 
      The Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative database (n = 795) had an overall SSO 
      and SSI rate of 23% and 17%, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.56, 0.54, 
      0.52, and 0.60) and SSI (0.55, 0.53, 0.50, and 0.58). The VHRS (P = 0.01) and 
      HW-RAT (P < 0.01) significantly stratified patients into tiers for SSO, whereas 
      the VHWG (P < 0.05) and HW-RAT (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In the Prospective 
      database (n = 88), 14% and 8% developed an SSO and SSI, respectively. The AUCs 
      were low for SSO (0.63, 0.54, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.69) and modest for SSI (0.81, 
      0.64, 0.55, 0.62, and 0.73). The ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.01) stratified for SSO, whereas 
      the VHRS (P < 0.01) and ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In both 
      databases, VHRS, VHWG, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      overestimated risk of SSO and SSI, whereas HW-RAT and ACS-NSQIP underestimated 
      risk for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: All five existing predictive models have 
      limited ability to risk-stratify patients and accurately assess risk of SSO. 
      However, both the VHRS and ACS-NSQIP demonstrate modest success in identifying 
      patients at risk for SSI. Continued model refinement is needed to improve the two 
      highest performing models (VHRS and ACS-NSQIP) along with investigation to 
      determine whether modifications to perioperative management based on risk 
      stratification can improve outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted 
      imaging (DWI) in predicting the development of vascularization in hypovascular 
      hepatocellular lesions (HHLs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two HHLs that were 
      diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) arteriography were evaluated 
      retrospectively. The lesion on DWI was classified as isointense, hypointense, or 
      hyperintense. Follow-up studies that included intravenous dynamic CT or magnetic 
      resonance imaging were performed. RESULTS: The 730-day cumulative developments of 
      vascularization in hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense lesions were 17%, 
      30%, and 40%, respectively. The differences among these developments were not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The signal intensity on DWI showed no 
      significant difference in the development of vascularization.

TI  - Does confined placental mosaicism account for adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF 
      pregnancies?
PG  - 1107-12
LID - 10.1093/humrep/den062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: IVF singletons have poorer perinatal outcomes than singletons from 
      spontaneous conceptions. This may be due to the influence of ovarian stimulation 
      on the chromosomal constitution of the embryos which could be translated into 
      localized chromosomal anomalies in the placenta. The aim of this study was to 
      compare the incidence of confined placental mosaicism (CPM) in IVF/ICSI 
      pregnancies and spontaneous conceptions. METHODS: We conducted a multi-centre 
      retrospective analysis of karyotype results obtained by chorionic villus sampling 
      (CVS), performed due to advanced maternal age (>or=36 years at 18 weeks of 
      gestation), in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2005. RESULTS: From a total of 
      322 246 pregnancies, 20 885 CVS results were analysed: 235 in the IVF/ICSI group 
      and 20 650 in the control group. The mean age of women in both groups was 38.4 
      years (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.18). Data relating to the fetal 
      karyotype were missing in 143 cases in the control group. When taking into 
      account missing data, the incidence of CPM was lower in the IVF-ICSI group than 
      in the control group, 1.3% versus 2.2% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.19-1.85), 
      whereas the incidence of fetal chromosomal anomalies was increased 4.3% versus 
      2.4% (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.95-3.42). Neither differences were statistically 
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI 
      pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account 
      for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.

TI  - Do elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones?
PG  - 374-9
AB  - AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The increasingly older population confronts oncologists with 
      an imposing challenge: older cancer patients have specific healthcare needs both 
      independent of and associated with the diagnosis of cancer. The aim of the 
      present study is to examine whether elderly versus younger cancer patients have 
      different needs with respect to attendance, treatment and information. METHODS 
      AND STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational and cross-sectional study. Cancer 
      patients aged 35 to 82 years were consecutively interviewed. The group was 
      divided into two subgroups aged </=65 and >/=66 years old. The Needs Evaluation 
      Questionnaire (NEQ) was used to assess patients' needs and demographic variables 
      were collected. Data analysis was carried out by means of cross-tabulation 
      analyses and the chi-square test. RESULTS: The requests most frequently expressed 
      by the older group concerned financial-insurance information (73.9%), the need to 
      talk to people with the same illness (71.7%), the need to receive more 
      comprehensible information from doctors and nurses (71.7%), and the need for a 
      better dialogue with clinicians (69.6%). Few significant differences between the 
      two age subgroups were found, with the exception of issues such as the need for 
      intimacy and support. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients have informational and 
      relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole 
      sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially 
      concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need 
      to talk to people with the same illness.

TI  - Does increased nerve length within the treatment volume improve trigeminal 
      neuralgia radiosurgery? A prospective double-blind, randomized study.
PG  - 449-54
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that increasing the nerve length within the 
      treatment volume for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery would improve pain relief. 
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-seven patients with typical trigeminal neuralgia 
      were randomized to undergo retrogasserian gamma knife radiosurgery (75 Gy maximal 
      dose with 4-mm diameter collimators) using either one (n = 44) or two (n = 43) 
      isocenters. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 1-36). RESULTS: Pain relief 
      was complete in 57 patients (45 without medication and 12 with low-dose 
      medication), partial in 15, and minimal in another 15 patients. The actuarial 
      rate of obtaining complete pain relief (with or without medication) was 67.7% +/- 
      5.1%. The pain relief was identical for one- and two-isocenter radiosurgery. Pain 
      relapsed in 30 of 72 responding patients. Facial numbness and mild and severe 
      paresthesias developed in 8, 5, and 1 two-isocenter patients vs. 3, 4, and 0 
      one-isocenter patients, respectively (p = 0.23). Improved pain relief correlated 
      with younger age (p = 0.025) and fewer prior procedures (p = 0.039) and 
      complications (numbness or paresthesias) correlated with the nerve length 
      irradiated (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the treatment volume to include a 
      longer nerve length for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery does not significantly 
      improve pain relief but may increase complications.

TI  - Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent?
PG  - 952-6
AB  - AIM: To ascertain whether recovery of visual function in amblyopic eyes is likely 
      to occur when the fellow eye is lost as a result of age related macular 
      degeneration. METHODS: The records of 465 patients with an established diagnosis 
      of age related macular degeneration who had attended a specialist macular clinic 
      between 1990 and 1998 were scrutinised. A full clinical examination and 
      standardised refraction had been carried out in 189 of these cases on a minimum 
      of two occasions. Cases were looked for where an improvement of one or more lines 
      of either distance or near acuity was recorded in the eye unaffected by macular 
      disease. In each one of these cases the improvement in visual acuity could not be 
      attributed to treatment of other existing pathology. RESULTS: 12 such cases were 
      detected. In nine of these the eye showing improvement of acuity had a history of 
      amblyopia. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 
      12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively. The improvement in acuity 
      generally occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over 
      the period of follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Older people with a history of amblyopia 
      who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of 
      visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in 
      visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the 
      improvement appears to be sustained.

TI  - Are physicians meeting the needs of family caregivers of the frail elderly?
PG  - 679-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore expressed needs, both formal and informal, of family 
      caregivers of frail elderly. To evaluate roles of physicians. DESIGN: 
      Questionnaire survey of members of the Montreal Jewish community providing care 
      for frail elderly family members. SETTING: Jewish community of Montreal. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer caregivers who were caring for a family member or friend 
      60 years or older, who had greatest responsibility for providing physical or 
      emotional support to an elderly person, who saw themselves as caregivers, and who 
      could speak English or French were studied. Of 118 volunteers, 32 were excluded 
      because they withdrew for personal reasons or because they did not meet study 
      criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic variables, functional status of the 
      care receiver, use of home care services, and needs assessment to identify 
      additional services. RESULTS: An average of 75.4% respondents did not use formal 
      support services. Just under half of caregivers were dissatisfied with the 
      attention they received from the health care system, and more than one third 
      expressed feelings of stress, depression, guilt, and isolation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Hypotheses for this discontent are presented. Physicians may be uninterested in 
      helping caregivers; even if they were receptive to counseling caregivers, they 
      could be poorly remunerated for the types of counseling sessions that are usual 
      for caregivers; and being a professional caregiver to family caregivers is 
      demanding in itself.

TI  - Will CT ordering practices change if we educate residents about the potential 
      effects of radiation exposure? Experience at a large academic medical center.
PG  - 1447-52
LID - 10.1016/j.acra.2011.07.006 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine if educating 
      residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from computed 
      tomographic (CT) imaging alters ordering patterns. This study also explored 
      whether referring physicians are interested in radiation education and was an 
      initial effort to address their CT ordering behavior. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two 
      to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of 
      radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were 
      surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of 
      alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to 
      educate patients. RESULTS: Twenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the 
      survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% 
      (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered 
      changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 
      21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% 
      (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 
      21) reporting increases in ultrasound. Patients directed questions about 
      radiation exposure to 57% (12 of 21); 38% (eight of 21) used the lecture 
      information to educate patients. Referring physicians were interested in the 
      topic, and afterward, other physician groups requested radiation education 
      lectures. CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering 
      after receiving education about radiation from a radiologist. Radiation education 
      allowed clinicians to discuss CT benefits and risks with their patients and to 
      choose appropriate CT protocols. Referring physician groups are interested in 
      this topic, and radiologists should be encouraged to give radiation lectures to 
      them.

LID - 70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orthodontic patients show high prevalence of tooth-size discrepancy. 
      This study investigates the possible association between arch form, clinically 
      significant tooth-size discrepancy, and sagittal molar relationship. METHODS: 
      Pretreatment orthodontic casts of 230 Saudi patients were classified into one of 
      three arch form types (tapered, ovoid, and square) using digitally scanned images 
      of the mandibular arches. Bolton ratio was calculated, sagittal molar 
      relationship was defined according to Angle classification, and correlations were 
      analyzed using ANOVA, chi-square, and t-tests. RESULTS: No single arch form was 
      significantly more common than the others. Furthermore, no association was 
      observed between the presence of significant Bolton discrepancy and the sagittal 
      molar relationship or arch form. Overall Bolton discrepancy is significantly more 
      prevalent in males. CONCLUSIONS: Arch form in a Saudi patient group is 
      independent of gender, sagittal molar relationship, and Bolton discrepancy.

TI  - Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the 
      transabdominal pull-through? A comparison of the 2 approaches for Hirschsprung 
      disease.
PG  - 41-7; discussion 47
AB  - PURPOSE: The transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) is becoming the most 
      popular procedure in the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD), but 
      overstretching of the anal sphincters remains a critical issue that may impact 
      the continence. This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus 
      conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. METHODS: Records of 41 
      patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 
      20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed 
      and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. 
      Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our 
      group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 
      0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 
      2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear 
      regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval 
      higher than 95%. RESULTS: Overall scores were similar. However, continence score 
      was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better 
      in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 
      groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this 
      showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome 
      between groups. CONCLUSION: Our long-term study showed significantly better 
      (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach 
      compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis 
      scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an 
      important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases 
      will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.

TI  - [Should temperature be monitorized during kidney allograft preservation?].
PG  - 430-4
LID - 10.1016/j.purol.2009.11.004 [doi]
AB  - GOAL: It is generally considered that kidney grafts should be preserved at 4 
      degrees C during cold storage. However, actual temperature conditions are not 
      known. We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the 
      Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack. MATERIAL: Temperature was 
      monitored using the Thermobouton probe during preservation of pig kidneys, in the 
      same conditions used with human grafts. The probe recorded the temperature level 
      every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new 
      storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can 
      formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for 
      temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the 
      transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during 
      the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from 
      August 2007 to May 2008. RESULTS: The temperature levels were the same regardless 
      of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature 
      was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees 
      C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the 
      lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C 
      after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of 
      crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the 
      conservation of human grafts. CONCLUSION: The new storage can affords more stable 
      temperature levels when compared to the formerly used can. Since temperature is 
      stable during conservation, continuous monitoring in everyday practice does not 
      seem warranted.

TI  - Should all human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with end-stage renal 
      disease be excluded from transplantation? The views of U.S. transplant centers.
PG  - 1187-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients have generally 
      been excluded from transplantation. Recent advances in the management and 
      prognosis of these patients suggest that this policy should be reevaluated. 
      METHODS: To explore the current views of U.S. transplant centers toward 
      transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, a 
      written survey was mailed to the directors of transplantation at all 248 renal 
      transplant centers in the United States. RESULTS: All 148 responding centers said 
      they require HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients, and 84% of these 
      centers would not transplant an individual who refuses HIV testing. The vast 
      majority of responding centers would not transplant a kidney from a cadaveric 
      (88%) or a living donor (91%) into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who is 
      otherwise a good candidate for transplantation. Among the few centers that would 
      consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient, not a single center had performed 
      such a transplant in the year prior to the survey. Most centers fear that 
      transplantation in the face of HIV infection would be harmful to the individual, 
      and some believe that it would be a waste of precious organs. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to 
      HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is 
      asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review 
      of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.

TI  - Does minimal access major surgery in the newborn hurt less? An evaluation of 
      cumulative opioid doses.
PG  - 615-20
LID - 10.1016/j.ejpain.2010.11.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimal access surgery (MAS) in adults is associated with less 
      postoperative pain in comparison to conventional 'open' surgery. It is not known 
      whether this holds true for neonates as well. Less pain would imply that opioid 
      consumption can be reduced, which has a beneficial effect on morbidity. AIM: To 
      evaluate potential differences in' opioid consumption between neonates undergoing 
      thoracoscopic minimal access surgery or conventional surgery of esophageal 
      atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). METHODS: In this 
      retrospective cohort study we included two controls for each MAS patient, matched 
      on diagnosis, sex and age at surgery. Opioid dose titration was based on 
      validated pain scores (VAS and COMFORT behaviour), applied by protocol. 
      Cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 h and 7 days postoperatively were compared 
      between groups with the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 
      24 MAS patients (14 EA; 10 CDH). These were matched to 48 control patients (28 
      EA; 20 CDH). At none of the time points cumulative opioid (median in mg/kg (IQR)) 
      doses significantly differed between MAS patients and controls, both with CDH and 
      EA. For example at 24 h postoperative for CDH patients cumulative opioid doses 
      were [0.84(0.61-1.83) MAS vs. 1.06(0.60-1.36) p=1.0] controls, For EA patients at 
      24 h the cumulative opioid doses were [0.48(0.30-0.75) MAS vs. 0.49(0.35-0.79) 
      p=0.83] controls. This held true for the postoperative pain scores as well. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or 
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid 
      doses.

TI  - Does increased patient awareness improve accrual into cancer-related clinical 
      trials?
PG  - E13-9
LID - 10.1097/NCC.0b013e31820254db [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oncology literature cites that only 2% to 4% of patients participate 
      in research. Up to 85% of patients are unaware that clinical trials research is 
      being conducted at their treatment facility or that they might be eligible to 
      participate. OBJECTIVES: It was hypothesized that patients' satisfaction with 
      information regarding clinical trials would improve after targeted educational 
      interventions, and accruals to clinical trials would increase in the year 
      following those interventions. METHODS: All new patients referred to the cancer 
      center over a 4-month period were mailed a baseline survey to assess their 
      knowledge of clinical research. Subsequently, educational interventions were 
      provided, including an orientation session highlighting clinical trials, a 
      pamphlet, and a reference to a clinical trials Web site. A postintervention 
      survey was sent to the responders of the initial survey 3 months after the 
      initial mailing. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction with information significantly 
      increased after the interventions. There was no increase in subsequent enrollment 
      in clinical trials. Patients who indicated an inclination to participate in 
      clinical trials tended to have greater satisfaction with the information they 
      received. CONCLUSIONS: A set of educational interventions designed for cancer 
      patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical 
      research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as 
      of 1 year after the study. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The development of 
      educational interventions may be justified, but such interventions may require 
      prolonged implementation to establish benefit. Information relating to research 
      may be most effectively delivered by patients' primary cancer care providers.

TI  - Continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department: 
      are trainees learning complete surgical care?
PG  - 999-1003
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that exemplary surgical care involves a 
      surgeon's involvement in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative 
      periods. In an era of ever-expanding therapeutic modalities available to the 
      vascular surgeon, it is important that trainees gain experience in preoperative 
      decision-making and how this affects a patient's operative and postoperative 
      course. The purpose of this study was to define the current experience of 
      residents on a vascular surgery service regarding the continuity of care they are 
      able to provide for patients and the factors affecting this experience. METHODS: 
      This prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and 
      conducted at the University of British Columbia during January 2005. All patients 
      who underwent a vascular procedure at either of the two teaching hospitals were 
      included. In addition to type of case (emergent, outpatient, inpatient), resident 
      demographic data and involvement in each patient's care (preoperative assessment, 
      postoperative daily assessment, and follow-up clinic assessment) were recorded. 
      Categoric data were analyzed with the chi2 test. RESULTS: The study included 159 
      cases, of which 65% were elective same-day admission patients, 20% were elective 
      previously admitted patients; and 15% were emergent. The overall rate of 
      preoperative assessment was 67%, involvement in the decision to operate, 17%; 
      postoperative assessment on the ward, 79%; and patient follow-up in clinic, 3%. 
      The rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care (assessing patient pre-op and 
      post-op) was 57%. Emergent cases were associated with a significantly higher rate 
      of preoperative assessment (92% vs 63%, P < .05). For elective cases admitted 
      before the day of surgery compared with same-day admission patients, the rates of 
      preoperative assessment (78% vs 58%, P < .05) and involvement in the decision to 
      operate (16% vs 4%, P < .05) were significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is 
      especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery 
      accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of 
      care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic 
      modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in 
      structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.

TI  - [Health habits and vaccination status of Lebanese residents: are future doctors 
      applying the rules of prevention?].
PG  - 91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has never been a nationally representative survey of medical 
      students' personal health-related practices, although they are inherently of 
      interest and may affect patient-counseling practices. This study evaluated the 
      health practices and the vaccination status of first year residents working at 
      the academic hospital Hotel-Dieu de France. METHODS: The medical files of all 
      medicine and surgery residents in their first year of specialization between the 
      years 2005 and 2008 were reviewed. These residents were required to go through a 
      preventive medical visit at the University Center of Family and Community Health. 
      RESULTS: One hundred and nine residents (109) were included in the study; 68 
      (6239%) were male and 41 (37.61%) were female with a mean age of 26 years. Only 6 
      residents (5.50%) practiced physical activity according to international 
      guidelines (more than three times a week for more than 30 minutes each time). 
      Most residents (n = 76 ; 69.73%) used to skip one or two meals especially 
      breakfast and as a consequence 30 male (44.11%) and 4 female (9.75%) students 
      were overweight, with a statistical difference between the two sexes (Fisher 
      test, p-value = 0.001). Twenty-eight residents (25.69%) were smokers with a male 
      predominance. Fourteen residents of both genders (12.84%) drank alcohol regularly 
      (> 3 times a week) and 71 (65.14%) had a drink occasionally (once a month or 
      less). Only 25 residents (23%) of the cohort had a complete and up-to-date 
      immunization status. The immunization gap was basically against measles, mumps, 
      rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis (dT Polio). Ninety-nine 
      residents (90.83%) had full immunization against hepatitis B with an adequate 
      response in 78 residents (71.56%). CONCLUSION: This study showed that our 
      residents did not always have a healthy lifestyle especially when it comes to 
      physical activity and eating habits. They also lacked an adequate vaccination. 
      Interventions should take place in order to promote healthy life style and to 
      improve their vaccination status.

TI  - [Landolt C and snellen e acuity: differences in strabismus amblyopia?].
PG  - 24-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for 
      measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their 
      critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are 
      evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, 
      differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, 
      visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with 
      various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 
      healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C 
      (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual 
      acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while 
      wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower 
      visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were 
      small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire 
      group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean 
      difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines 
      for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. 
      The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between 
      LR and SE. CONCLUSION: Using the charts described, there was only a slight 
      overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even 
      in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have 
      to be considered.

TI  - The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism. A candidate gene for 
      insulin resistance?
PG  - 3390-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The insertion/deletion (ID) polymorphism of the 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with increased 
      coronary heart disease (CHD), although the mechanism of this association is not 
      apparent. We tested the hypothesis that the deletion allele of the ACE gene is 
      associated with insulin resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: We related ACE genotype 
      to components of the insulin-resistance syndrome in 103 non-insulin-dependent 
      diabetic (NIDDM) and 533 nondiabetic white subjects. NIDDM subjects with the DD 
      genotype had significantly lower levels of specific insulin (DD 38.6, ID 57.1, 
      and II 87.4 pmol.L-1 by ANOVA, P = .011). Non-insulin-treated subjects with the 
      DD genotype had increased insulin sensitivity by HOMA % (DD 56.4%, II 29.4%, P = 
      .027) and lower levels of des 31,32 proinsulin (DD 3.3, II 7.6 pmol.L-1, P = 
      .012) compared with II subjects. There were no differences in prevalence of CHD 
      or levels of blood pressure, serum lipids, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 
      (PAI-1) activity between the three ACE genotypes. In nondiabetic subjects there 
      were no differences in insulin sensitivity, levels of insulin-like molecules, 
      blood pressure, PAI-1, serum lipids, or CHD prevalence between the three ACE 
      genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD 
      genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in 
      fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects 
      with the ACE DD genotype.

TI  - Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during 
      pregnancy?
PG  - 293-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate if fetal gender (1) affects the risk of having an 
      emergency department (ED) visit for asthma; and (2) is associated with adverse 
      pregnancy outcomes among women who had at least one visit to the ED for asthma 
      during pregnancy. METHODS: We linked two provincial administrative databases 
      containing records on in-patient deliveries and ED visits. The study sample 
      included women who delivered a live singleton baby between April 2003 and March 
      2004. Pregnant women who made at least one ED visit for asthma were counted as 
      cases and the rest of the women as control subjects. We performed a multivariable 
      analysis using logistic regression to model the risk of having an ED visit for 
      asthma, with fetal gender being one of the predictors. In addition, a series of 
      multivariable logistic regressions were also constructed separately for cases and 
      controls for the following adverse delivery outcomes: low birth weight baby, 
      preterm delivery, and delivery via Caesarian section. RESULTS: Among 109,173 live 
      singleton deliveries, 530 women had visited ED due to asthma during pregnancy. 
      While having an ED visit for asthma was positively associated with teenage 
      pregnancy, low income, and presence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, it was not 
      associated with fetal gender (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19). Fetal gender was not a 
      significant predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma 
      ED visit during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Fetal gender does not affect the risk of 
      having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with 
      adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during 
      pregnancy.

TI  - Blunt trauma in intoxicated patients: is computed tomography of the abdomen 
      always necessary?
PG  - 403-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical examination to detect abdominal injuries has been considered 
      unreliable in alcohol-intoxicated trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) plays 
      the primary role in these abdominal evaluations. METHODS: We reviewed medical 
      records of all blunt trauma patients admitted to our trauma service from January 
      1, 1992, to March 31, 1998. Study patients had a blood alcohol level > or =80 
      mg/dL, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, and unremarkable abdominal 
      examination. RESULTS: Of 324 patients studied, 317 (98%) had CT scans negative 
      for abdominal injury. Abdominal injuries were identified in 7 patients (2%), with 
      only 2 (0.6%) requiring abdominal exploration. A significant association was 
      found between major chest injury and abdominal injury. CONCLUSION: The incidence 
      of abdominal injury in intoxicated, hemodynamically stable, blunt trauma patients 
      with a normal abdominal examination and normal mentation is low. Physical 
      examination and attention to clinical risk factors allow accurate abdominal 
      evaluation without CT.

TI  - Risk factors for avascular necrosis of bone in patients with systemic lupus 
      erythematosus: is there a role for antiphospholipid antibodies?
PG  - 462-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) is a well known complication in 
      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      role of antiphospholipid antibody status (IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies 
      and lupus anticoagulant) with adjustment for corticosteroid use as risk factors 
      for the development of AVN. METHODS: A cohort of 265 patients receiving long term 
      follow up in our SLE clinic from 1978 to 1998 was analysed. Patients with AVN 
      complications were detected and then matched for age, sex, ethnicity, duration of 
      disease, and organ disease with two other patients with SLE. A further 31 
      patients were chosen at random for the analysis. RESULTS: Eleven patients had 
      AVN, giving a point prevalence of 4%. There were no significant differences 
      demonstrable in the presence of individual antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) or 
      their combination between the group with AVN or the two control groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Incorporating an adjustment for corticosteroid use we were unable to 
      show a link between the presence of aPL and the development of AVN in patients 
      with SLE.

TI  - Volume change of uterine myomas during pregnancy: do myomas really grow?
PG  - 386-90
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in uterine myoma volume during pregnancy. 
      DESIGN: Review of departmental electronic perinatal database and medical records. 
      Canadian Task Force Classification II-3. SETTING: Obstetrical ultrasound unit in 
      an academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred-seven patients diagnosed 
      with uterine myomas during pregnancy and who had two or more obstetrical 
      ultrasounds in different periods of pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS: We analyzed the 
      change in volume of uterine myomas between the first half of pregnancy (up until 
      19 weeks), third quarter (20-30 weeks), and last quarter (31 weeks to term). The 
      volume of largest uterine myoma was calculated using the formula Volume 
      (mm3)=Pi/6x(length mm)x(width mm)x(height mm). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The 
      mean age of the population was 31+/-6 years. Between the first and the second 
      study periods, the percentage of uterine myomas that decreased in size was 55.1% 
      (95% CI: 43-66), with a mean decrease in volume of 35%+/-4%; while the percentage 
      of uterine myomas that enlarged was 44.9% (95% CI: 34-56), with a mean increase 
      in volume of 69%+/-11%. Between the second and the third study periods, 75% (95% 
      CI: 56-87) became smaller, with a mean decrease in volume of 30%+/-3%; while 25% 
      (95% CI: 13-43) enlarged, with a mean increase in volume of 102%+/-62%. 
      CONCLUSION: Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly 
      decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.

TI  - Do foreign bodies migrate through the body towards the heart?
PG  - 195-9
AB  - Fixation of foreign bodies (FB), in the mucosa, can favor its migration, giving 
      origin to the popular saying: 'FB walk to the heart'. AIM: Describe the 
      mechanisms involved in FB migration and how to diagnose them. METHODOLOGY: From a 
      sample of 3,000 foreign bodies, during 40 years, we analyzed four which had 
      extra-lumen migration. We analyzed clinical, radiologic, endoscopic and 
      ultrasound data collected at the medical documentation service. RESULTS: Three 
      clinical histories are presented, describing two fish bones and one piece of fish 
      cartilage. FB shifting was analyzed in all of them. Migration started in the 
      esophagus in two, one going to the aorta and the other to the neck area. In the 
      other two, migration started in the pharynx, and the FB moved towards the 
      prevertebral fascia and the other externalized in the submandibular region. The 
      mechanisms and the risks posed to the patient, by FB migration, and the way to 
      diagnose them are hereby discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The study allows us to determine 
      that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also 
      serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, 
      imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.

TI  - Does concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improve the 
      overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence?
PG  - 1269-75
LID - 10.1007/s00192-014-2400-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Midurethral sling (MUS) can improve overactive 
      bladder (OAB) symptoms. It is unclear if anterior/apical prolapse (AA) repair 
      provides additional benefit. We hypothesized that women with mixed urinary 
      incontinence (MUI) experience greater improvement in the OAB component of their 
      symptoms after concomitant MUS and AA repair compared with MUS alone. METHODS: 
      This is a retrospective cohort study of women with bothersome MUI (defined by 
      objective stress test and validated questionnaire) undergoing MUS alone 
      ("MUS-only") or concomitant MUS and AA repair ("MUS + AA"). Our primary outcome 
      was the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity (OAB-q SS) change score 
      6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Of 151 women, 67 (44 %) underwent MUS-only and 84 
      (56 %) underwent MUS + AA. The MUS-only cohort was younger and had less severe 
      baseline prolapse (p < 0.05 for both). Postoperative complications (predominantly 
      UTI) occurred in 35 (23 %) patients and were similar between cohorts. For all 
      subjects mean OAB-q SS scores significantly improved postoperatively (p < 0.05). 
      Our primary outcome, OAB-q SS change score, showed no significant differences 
      between cohorts (30 +/- 26 MUS-only vs 25 +/- 25 MUS + AA, p = 0.20), indicating 
      similar improvements in OAB symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis 
      revealed no difference in OAB-q SS change score between cohorts; however, OAB-q 
      SS change scores were lower for women with a postoperative complication (beta = -19, 
      95 % CI -31 to -6; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In women with bothersome MUI, 
      concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms 
      over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less 
      improvement in OAB symptoms.

TI  - Is hypoalbuminemia an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric 
      cancer?
PG  - 2393-8
LID - 10.1007/s00268-010-0641-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with 
      decreased survival of patients with gastric cancer. However, the prognostic value 
      of albumin may be secondary to an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. The aim 
      of the study was to assess the relation between hypoalbuminemia, the systemic 
      inflammatory response, and survival in patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: 
      Patients diagnosed with gastric carcinoma attending the upper gastrointestinal 
      surgical unit in the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow between April 1997 and December 
      2005 and who had a pretreatment measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein 
      (CRP) were studied. RESULTS: Most of the patients had stage III/IV disease and 
      received palliative treatment. The minimum follow-up was 15 months. During 
      follow-up, 157 (72%) patients died of their cancer. On univariate analysis, stage 
      (p < 0.001), treatment (p < 0.001), albumin level (p < 0.001), and CRP level (p < 
      0.001) were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis, stage 
      (p < 0.001), treatment (p < 0.001), and CRP level (p < 0.001) remained 
      significant predictors of survival. Albumin was no longer an independent 
      predictor of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Low albumin concentrations are associated 
      with poorer survival in patients with gastric cancer. However, the strength of 
      this relation with survival is dependent on the presence of a systemic 
      inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated CRP level. Therefore, it 
      appears that the relation between hypoalbuminemia and poor survival is secondary 
      to that of the systemic inflammatory response.

TI  - Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Results 
      from the Japanese World Health Survey.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anchoring vignettes are brief texts describing a hypothetical 
      character who illustrates a certain fixed level of a trait under evaluation. This 
      research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in 
      adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in 
      self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting 
      heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. 
      METHODS: We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over 
      from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through 
      face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the 
      Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring 
      vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy 
      with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for 
      differences in response category cut-points for each individual. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without 
      correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were 
      significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After 
      correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were 
      significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex 
      was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the 
      CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of 
      regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: 
      Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction 
      for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for 
      proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. 
      Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the 
      presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of 
      policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.

TI  - Can the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp predict a neoplastic polyp?
PG  - 865-8
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31819359aa [doi]
AB  - GOALS: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the growth rate of a 
      gallbladder (GB) polyp is a predictive indicator for neoplastic polyps. 
      BACKGROUND: Cholecystectomy for GB polyps that are larger than 10 mm is generally 
      recommended because of the high probability of neoplasm. In contrast, a follow-up 
      strategy is preferred for GB polyps smaller than 10 mm. However, there are no 
      treatment guidelines for polyps that grow in size during the follow-up period. 
      STUDY: We retrospectively investigated 145 patients with GB polyps who underwent 
      at least 1 ultrasonographic follow-up examination over an interval greater than 6 
      months, before cholecystectomy at Samsung medical center, South Korea, from 1994 
      to 2007. The growth rate was determined based on the change in size per time 
      interval between 2 ultrasonographic examinations (mm/mo). RESULTS: The median age 
      of the patients was 48 years (range: 25 to 75). One hundred twenty-five 
      non-neoplastic polyps and 20 neoplastic polyps were found. Neoplastic polyps were 
      more frequently found in patients older than 60 years, those with hypertension, a 
      polyp size greater than 10 mm, and a rapid growth rate greater than 0.6 mm/mo. On 
      multivariate analysis, however, the growth rate was not related to the neoplastic 
      nature of a polyp, but older age (>60 y) and large size (>10 mm) were 
      significantly associated with neoplastic polyps. CONCLUSIONS: Patient's age (>60 
      y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for 
      neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require 
      surgical intervention simply because they grow.

TI  - Preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer: is there a place for 
      magnetic resonance imaging? Prospective comparison with EUS and multidetector 
      computed tomography.
PG  - 216-25
LID - 10.1007/s10120-015-0468-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic 
      performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multidetector computed 
      tomography (MDCT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the preoperative 
      locoregional staging of gastric cancer. METHODS: This study had Institutional 
      Review Board approval, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. 
      Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T 
      MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results 
      were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of 
      the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the 
      local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated 
      and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test. 
      RESULTS: For T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 
      and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher 
      specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to 
      MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity. For N 
      staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (92%) than MRI and MDCT (69 and 73%; p = 
      0.01 and p = 0.02). MDCT showed better specificity (81%) than EUS and MRI (58 and 
      73%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study confirmed the 
      leading role of EUS and MDCT in the staging of gastric cancer and did not prove, 
      at present, the value of the clinical use of MRI.

TI  - Are hepatitis G virus and TT virus involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease?
PG  - 53-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis G virus can cause chronic infection in man but the role of 
      this agent in chronic liver disease is poorly understood. Little is known about 
      the relation of another newly discovered agent, the TT virus, with chronic liver 
      disease. AIM: To investigate the rate of infection with hepatitis G virus and TT 
      virus in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease. PATIENTS: A total of 23 
      subjects with chronically raised alanine transaminase and a liver biopsy in whom 
      all known causes of liver disease had been excluded, and 40 subjects with 
      hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. METHODS: Evaluation of 
      anti-hepatitis G virus by enzyme immunoassay. Hepatitis G virus-RNA by polymerase 
      chain reaction with primers from the 5' NC and NS5a regions. TT virus-DNA by 
      nested polymerase chain reaction with primers from the ORF1 region. Results. 
      Hepatitis G virus-RNA was detected in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic 
      chronic hepatitis and in 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis 
      (17.4% vs 15% p=ns). At least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection 
      (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus, mostly mutually exclusive) 
      was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic hepatitis and 16 out of 40 
      with hepatitis C virus liver disease (26. 1% vs 40% p=ns). T virus-DNA was 
      present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C 
      virus-related chronic liver disease. Demographic and clinical features, including 
      stage and grade of liver histology, were comparable between hepatitis G 
      virus-infected and uninfected subjects. Severe liver damage [chronic hepatitis 
      with fibrosis or cirrhosis) were significantly more frequent in subjects with 
      hepatitis C virus liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: In Southern Italy, hepatitis G 
      virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, 
      independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with 
      cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic 
      liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus 
      infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related 
      liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.

TI  - Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications 
      when undergoing cardiac surgery?
PG  - 353-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) 
      are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery 
      with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study 
      to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients. METHODS: 
      Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) 
      underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five 
      of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by 
      immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients 
      without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number 
      of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria. RESULTS: Mean 
      number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the 
      no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after 
      immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018). On the day before, directly 
      after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 
      75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients 
      of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients 
      of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, 
      P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost 
      identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group). One patient 
      of each group suffered from a bleeding complication requiring reexploration. 
      Three patients of the no-WD-group (6%) and one patient of the WD-group (10%) 
      expired postoperatively unrelated to WD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WD may 
      possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding 
      complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly 
      lower platelet counts perioperatively.

TI  - Does Mammographic Density have an Impact on the Margin Re-excision Rate After 
      Breast-Conserving Surgery?
PG  - 782-8
LID - 10.1245/s10434-015-4917-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited and conflicting data exist on an association between 
      mammographic density (MD) and re-excision rates after breast-conserving surgery 
      (BCS). Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins 
      during initial BCS is unknown. METHODS: All women with a diagnosis of breast 
      cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. 
      Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and 
      involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting 
      and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program 
      (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy 
      specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [>/=2 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ 
      (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed. RESULTS: Of 655 patients, 398 
      (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with 
      denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than 
      the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of 
      the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional 
      margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving 
      to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts 
      according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward 
      requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the 
      multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast 
      density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS 
      (p < 0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for 
      re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.

TI  - Are UK radiologists satisfied with the training and support received in suspected 
      child abuse?
PG  - 690-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crad.2009.02.012 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine current practice and perceptions of the adequacy of training 
      and support received for the reporting of skeletal surveys in suspected physical 
      child abuse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A list of telephone numbers of UK hospitals 
      with a radiology department was obtained from the Royal College of Radiologists. 
      One hundred hospitals were then randomly selected for inclusion in the survey. An 
      18-item questionnaire was successfully administered to consultant radiologists 
      from 84 departments. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of departments had a named 
      radiologist to report their skeletal surveys, 16% assigned surveys to a random 
      radiologist, and 23% referred them elsewhere. Only 52% of departments had a 
      dedicated paediatric radiologist, thus in a significant proportion of departments 
      (25%) initial reports on skeletal surveys for physical abuse were provided by 
      non-paediatric radiologists. Fifteen percent did not have ready access to a 
      paediatric radiology opinion. Sixty-one percent thought that the service could be 
      improved. Expert evidence was provided by 5% of respondents. Seventy-three 
      percent would never consider providing expert evidence, even if given adequate 
      radiology and/or legal training. CONCLUSION: The survey shows significant 
      dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, 
      confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and 
      suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 
      27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education 
      strategies should be implemented.

TI  - Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents?
PG  - e65
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.L.00824 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine 
      radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are 
      clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation 
      exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. 
      The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique 
      views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. METHODS: Radiographs of fifty 
      adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls 
      were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have 
      spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance 
      imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique 
      radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one 
      showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) 
      and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were 
      randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view 
      slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty 
      random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater 
      agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. 
      Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the 
      percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). 
      PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were 
      determined from radiology billing data. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view 
      radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The sensitivity was 0.59 for 
      two-view studies and 0.53 for four-view studies (p = 0.33). The specificity was 
      0.96 for two-view studies and 0.94 for four-view studies (p = 0.60). Inter-rater 
      agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement with gold-standard ICC values 
      were in the moderate range and also demonstrated no significant differences. 
      Percent overall agreement was 78% for four-view studies and 82% for two-view 
      studies. The radiation effective dose was 1.26 mSv for four-view studies and 0.72 
      mSv for two-view studies (difference, 0.54 mSv). The charge for four-view studies 
      was $145 more than that for two-view studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference 
      in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view studies. Although 
      oblique views have long been considered standard practice by some, our data could 
      not identify a diagnostic benefit that might outweigh the additional cost and 
      radiation exposure.

TI  - The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct 
      stones?
PG  - 769-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found 
      to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor 
      of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly 
      defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of 
      frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic 
      therapy. METHODS: The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic 
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected 
      choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS 
      but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors 
      for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or 
      angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data 
      (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning. 
      RESULTS: Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more 
      common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% 
      (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with 
      BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group. 
      The other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open 
      cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary 
      diverticulum) were not statistically different between the two groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic 
      BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage 
      of choledocholithiasis.

TI  - Can bedside assessment reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke?
PG  - 99-106
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of a bedside swallowing assessment to 
      reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke. SUBJECTS: Consecutive 
      patients admitted within 24 h of stroke onset to two hospitals. METHODS: A 
      prospective study. Where possible, all patients had their ability to swallow 
      assessed on the day of admission by both a doctor and a speech and language 
      therapist using a standardized proforma. A videofluoroscopy examination was 
      conducted within 3 days of admission. RESULTS: 94 patients underwent 
      videofluoroscopy; 20 (21%) were seen to be aspirating, although this was not 
      detected at the bedside in 10. In 18 (22%) of the patients the speech and 
      language therapist considered the swallow to be unsafe. In the medical 
      assessment, 39 patients (41%) had an unsafe swallow. Bedside assessment by a 
      speech and language therapist gave a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 86%, 
      positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 
      85% for the presence of aspiration. Multiple logistic regression was used to 
      identify the optimum elements of the bedside assessments for predicting the 
      presence of aspiration. A weak voluntary cough and any alteration in conscious 
      level gave a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 72%, PPV of 41% and NPV of 91% 
      for aspiration. CONCLUSION: Bedside assessment of swallowing lacks the necessary 
      sensitivity to be used as a screening instrument in acute stroke, but there are 
      concerns about the use of videofluoroscopy as a gold standard. The relative 
      importance of aspiration and bedside assessment in predicting complications and 
      outcome needs to be studied.

TI  - Does frozen section alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease?
PG  - 179-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frozen section (FS) evaluation during thyroid surgery is often used 
      to guide intraoperative management. We sought to determine the utility of FS in 
      patients undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular thyroid disease. METHODS: From 
      May 1994 through November 2004, 236 patients with multinodular goiter underwent 
      thyroidectomy at our institution. Patient data were retrospectively analyzed to 
      see if a frozen section was performed during the procedure and whether it changed 
      the patient's outcome. RESULTS: Of the 236 patients, 135 (57%) had 
      intra-operative FS. There were no differences between patients who had FS 
      analysis and those who did not with regard to age, gender, and the incidence of 
      malignancy. Of the patients who had FS, 4/135 (3%) were subsequently diagnosed 
      with thyroid cancer on permanent histology. Three of these FS were misread as 
      benign. Therefore, the sensitivity of FS for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was 
      only 25%. Importantly, in none of the 135 patients did FS alter the 
      intraoperative management. CONCLUSION: While FS was commonly used in patients 
      undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade 
      did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to 
      perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not 
      be performed in these patients.

      case control study.
PG  - 345
LID - 10.1186/s12891-015-0803-z [doi]
LID - 345
AB  - BACKGROUND: Achilles tendon structure deteriorates 2-days after maximal loading 
      in elite athletes. The load-response behaviour of tendons may be altered in type 
      1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as hyperglycaemia accelerates collagen cross-linking. 
      This study compared Achilles tendon load-response in participants with T1DM and 
      controls. METHODS: Achilles tendon structure was quantified at day-0, day-2 and 
      day-4 after a 10 km run. Ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) measures tendon 
      structural integrity by classifying pixels as echo-type I, II, III or IV. 
      Echo-type I has the most aligned collagen fibrils and IV has the least. RESULTS: 
      Participants were 7 individuals with T1DM and 10 controls. All regularly ran 
      distances greater than 5 km and VISA-A scores indicated good tendon function 
      (T1DM = 94 +/- 11, control = 94 +/- 10). There were no diabetic complications and 
      HbA1c was 8.7 +/- 2.6 mmol/mol for T1DM and 5.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/mol for control groups. 
      Baseline tendon structure was similar in T1DM and control groups - UTC echo-types 
      (I-IV) and anterior-posterior thickness were all p > 0.05. No response to load 
      was seen in either T1DM or control group over the 4-days post exercise. 
      CONCLUSION: Active individuals with T1DM do not have a heightened Achilles tendon 
      response to load, which suggests no increased risk of tendon injury. We cannot 
      extrapolate these findings to sedentary individuals with T1DM.

TI  - Are higher rates of depression in women accounted for by differential symptom 
      reporting?
PG  - 126-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of depression 
      is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology. We sought to 
      examine whether any gender differences in symptom profile might account for this 
      difference in rates. METHOD: This study was a population-based 13-year follow-up 
      survey of community-dwelling adults living in East Baltimore in 1981. Subjects 
      were the continuing participants of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area 
      Program. Participants interviewed between 1993 and 1996 with complete data on 
      depressive symptoms and covariates were included (n = 1727). We applied 
      structural equations with a measurement model for dichotomous data (the 
      MIMIC-multiple indicators, multiple causes-model) to compare symptoms between 
      women and men, in relation to the nine symptom groups comprising the diagnostic 
      criteria for major depression, adjusting for several potentially influential 
      characteristics (namely, age, self-reported ethnicity, educational attainment, 
      marital status, and employment). RESULTS: There were no significant gender 
      differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even taking into account 
      the higher level of depressive symptoms of women and the influence of other 
      covariates. For example, women were no more likely to endorse sadness than were 
      men, as evidenced by a direct effect coefficient that was not significantly 
      different from the null [adjusted estimated direct effect of gender on report of 
      sadness = 0.105, 95% confidence interval (-0.113, 0.323)]. CONCLUSIONS: Men and 
      women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. 
      No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was 
      found.

TI  - Do Indigenous Australians age prematurely? The implications of life expectancy 
      and health conditions of older Indigenous people for health and aged care policy.
PG  - 68-74
LID - 10.1071/AH11996 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether Indigenous Australians age prematurely compared with 
      other Australians, as implied by Australian Government aged care policy, which 
      uses age 50 years and over for population-based planning for Indigenous people 
      compared with 70 years for non-indigenous people. METHODS: Cross-sectional 
      analysis of aged care assessment, hospital and health survey data comparing 
      Indigenous and non-indigenous age-specific prevalence of health conditions. 
      Analysis of life tables for Indigenous and non-indigenous populations comparing 
      life expectancy at different ages. RESULTS: At age 63 for women and age 65 for 
      men, Indigenous people had the same life expectancy as non-indigenous people at 
      age 70. There is no consistent pattern of a 20-year lead in age-specific 
      prevalence of age-associated conditions for Indigenous compared with other 
      Australians. There is high prevalence from middle-age onwards of some conditions, 
      particularly diabetes (type unspecified), but there is little or no lead for 
      others. CONCLUSION: The idea that Indigenous people age prematurely is not well 
      supported by this study of a series of discrete conditions. The current focus and 
      type of services provided by the aged care sector may not be the best way to 
      respond to the excessive burden of chronic disease and disability of middle-aged 
      Indigenous people.

TI  - Adjuvant radiation of stage III thymoma: is it necessary?
PG  - 1834-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The criteria for administration of adjuvant radiation therapy after 
      thymoma resection remains controversial, and it is unclear whether patients with 
      Masaoka stage III thymoma benefit from adjuvant radiation. The goal of this 
      report was to determine whether or not this group benefits from radiation therapy 
      in disease-specific survival and disease-free survival. METHODS: Case records of 
      the Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed from 1972 to 
      2004. One hundred and seventy-nine patients underwent resection for thymoma, of 
      which 45 had stage III disease. RESULTS: Forty-five stage III patients underwent 
      resection and in 36 it was complete. Thirty-eight stage III patients received 
      radiation therapy. Baseline prognostic factors between radiated and nonradiated 
      groups were similar. The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy did not alter local or 
      distant recurrence rates in patients with stage III thymoma. Disease-specific 
      survival at 10 years in stage III patients who did not receive radiation was 75% 
      (95% confidence interval, 32% to 100%) and in patients who did receive radiation 
      therapy it was 79% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 94%) (p = 0.21). The most 
      common site of relapse was the pleura. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients who have stage 
      III thymoma undergo complete resection. Some patients enjoy prolonged 
      disease-free survival without adjuvant radiation after resection of stage III 
      thymoma. Radiation does not seem to prevent pleural recurrences when given after 
      resection of stage III thymomas. The use of routine adjuvant radiation after a 
      complete resection of stage III thymoma needs to be re-addressed. There may be a 
      role for the use of chemotherapy to reduce pleural recurrences.

TI  - Are patients with diabetes receiving the same message from dietitians and nurses?
PG  - 293-300
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if registered dietitian (RD) 
      and registered nurse (RN) certified diabetes educators (CDEs) provide similar 
      recommendations regarding carbohydrates and dietary supplements to individuals 
      with diabetes. METHODS: A survey was mailed to CDEs in the southern United 
      States. Participants were asked to indicate their recommendations for use of 
      carbohydrates, fiber, artificial sweeteners, and 12 selected dietary and herbal 
      supplements when counseling individuals with diabetes. RESULTS: The survey sample 
      consisted of 366 CDEs: 207 were RNs and 159 were RDs. No statistically 
      significant differences were found between RNs and RDs in typical carbohydrate 
      recommendations for treatment of diabetes. However, RDs were more likely than RNs 
      to make recommendations for fiber intake or use of the glycemic index. A 
      significant difference also was found in the treatment of hypoglycemia: RNs were 
      more likely than RDs to recommend consuming a carbohydrate source with protein to 
      treat hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Although some differences existed, RD and RN 
      CDEs are making similar overall recommendations in the treatment of individuals 
      with diabetes.

TI  - Do lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking confer equal risk of myocardial 
      infarction in women as in men? The Reykjavik Study.
PG  - 67-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on coronary risk factors in men and women are mainly based on 
      mortality data and few compare results of both sexes with consistent study design 
      and diagnostic criteria. This study assesses the major risk factors for coronary 
      events in men and women from the Reykjavik Study. DESIGN: Within a prospective, 
      population-based cohort study individuals without history of myocardial 
      infarction were identified and the relative risk of baseline variables was 
      assessed in relation to verified myocardial infarction or coronary death during 
      follow-up. METHODS: Of the 9681 women and 8888 men who attended risk assessment 
      from 1967-1991, with follow-up period of up to 28 years, 706 women and 1700 men 
      suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death. RESULTS: Serum 
      cholesterol was a significant risk factor for both sexes, with hazard ratios (HR) 
      decreasing with age. Systolic blood pressure was a stronger risk factor for women 
      as was ECG-confirmed left ventricular hypertrophy (women HR 2.89, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 1.67-5.01; men HR 1.11 [CI 0.86-1.43]). Fasting blood glucose > or 
      =6.7 mmol/L identified significantly higher risk for women (HR 2.65) than men (HR 
      2.08) as did self-reported diabetes. Triglyceride risk was significantly higher 
      for women and decreased significantly with age. Smoking increased risk two- to 
      five-fold, increasing with dose, for women, which was significantly higher than 
      the doubling in risk for men. CONCLUSIONS: This large study of the major risk 
      factors compared between the sexes demonstrates similar relative risk of 
      myocardial infarction associated with cholesterol for both sexes, however, the 
      relative risk is higher in women for many other risk factors such as smoking, 
      diabetes, elevated triglycerides and left ventricular hypertrophy.

TI  - Diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers--an effect of arsenic exposure?
PG  - 146-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to search for evidence of an 
      association between occupational arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus, as 
      implied by the relation of this disease to arsenic in drinking water in a recent 
      study from Taiwan. METHODS: A case-referent analysis on death records of 5498 
      individuals in the art glass producing part of southeastern Sweden was performed. 
      Out of all the enrolled subjects, 888 were glass workers. According to 
      occupational title, glassblowers, foundry workers, and unspecified workers were 
      regarded as potentially exposed to arsenic. Persons with a diagnosis of diabetes 
      mellitus either as an underlying or contributing cause of death were considered 
      cases. Referents were decedents without any indication of cancer, cardiovascular 
      disease, or diabetes. RESULTS: A slightly elevated risk [Mantel-Haenszel odds 
      ratio (MH-OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.82-1.8] was found for 
      diabetes mellitus among the glassworks employees, especially in combination with 
      cardiovascular disease (MH-OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.81-2.3). For the glassblowers, other 
      foundry workers and unspecified glassworkers probably exposed to arsenic, the M-H 
      odds ratio was 1.4 (95% CI 0.92-2.2). Unspecified glass workers, who probably 
      included persons with high exposure, carried the higher risk (MH-OR 1.8, 95% CI 
      1.1-2.8). CONCLUSIONS: The observations from this study provide limited support 
      for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the 
      development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in 
      art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.

TI  - Preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. 
      Does PET/CT really add something to multidetector CT?
PG  - 2654-61
LID - 10.1245/s10434-011-1670-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine prospectively whether the 
      systematic use of PET/CT associated with conventional techniques could improve 
      the accuracy of staging in patients with liver metastases of colorectal 
      carcinoma. We also assessed the impact on the therapeutic strategy. METHODS: 
      Between 2006 and 2008, 97 patients who were evaluated for resection of LMCRC were 
      prospectively enrolled. Preoperative workup included multidetector-CT (MDCT) and 
      PET/CT. In 11 patients with liver steatosis or iodinated contrast allergy, MR 
      also was performed. Sixty-eight patients underwent laparotomy. Sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values for 
      hepatic and extrahepatic staging of MDCT and PET-CT were calculated. RESULTS: In 
      a lesion-by-lesion analysis of the hepatic staging, the sensitivity of MDCT/RM 
      was superior to PET/CT (89.2 vs. 55%, p < 0.001). On the extrahepatic staging, 
      PET/CT was superior to MDCT/MR only for the detection of locoregional recurrence 
      (p = 0.03) and recurrence in uncommon sites (p = 0.016). New findings in PET/CT 
      resulted in a change in therapeutic strategy in 17 patients. However, additional 
      information was correct only in eight cases and wrong in nine patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although 
      PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some 
      anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided 
      additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and 
      potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more 
      selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local 
      recurrence.

      technique?].
PG  - 53-9
LID - 10.1016/j.annfar.2011.08.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the risks of haemodynamic instability, and the possible 
      occurrence of spinal haematoma, meningitis and epidural abscess when epidural 
      analgesia is performed for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
      chemotherapy (HIPEC). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 35 
      patients treated by HIPEC with oxaliplatin or cisplatin. An epidural catheter was 
      inserted before induction of general anaesthesia. Postoperatively, a continuous 
      epidural infusion of ropivacain, then a patient-controlled epidural analgesia 
      were started. RESULTS: The epidural catheter was used peroperatively before HIPEC 
      in 12 subjects (34%), and after HIPEC in 23 subjects (66%). The median dose of 
      ropivacain given peroperatively in the epidural catheter was 40 mg (30-75). 
      Norepinephrin was used in two subjects (6%) peroperatively (median infusion rate 
      0.325 mug/kg per minute [0.32-0.33]), and in four subjects (11%) in the 
      postoperative 24 hours. No spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess were 
      noted. Five subjects (14%) had a thrombopenia or a prothrombin time less than 60% 
      before catheter removal. Two subjects (6%) had a leukopenia before catheter 
      removal. No thrombopenia or blood coagulation disorders were recorded the day of 
      catheter removal. CONCLUSION: In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural 
      analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of 
      haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC 
      with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, 
      with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of 
      perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.

TI  - Do acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affect aortic stiffness in 
      patients with hypertension?
PG  - 33-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased aortic stiffness is a independent risk factor of 
      cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Acute changes of the heart 
      rate (HR) have been reported not to affect the aortic stiffness in pacing. 
      However, it is unknown whether acute changes in HR caused by sympathomimetics can 
      affect the aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We investigated the 
      effect of acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol on the aortic stiffness 
      in 17 hypertensive patientss (mean age: 59 +/- 9 years). METHODS: All vasoactive 
      drugs were discontinued at least 3 days before the study. The carotid-to-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by the foot-to-foot method. The pulse 
      waves were recorded at the baseline and at every increase of HR by 5 to 10 bpm 
      with a gradual increase of the dose of isoproterenol. The blood pressures and HR 
      were measured simultaneously. For the analysis, HR, PWV, compliance (C), and 
      compliance index (Ci) were converted as percent changes (delta) from the baseline 
      values. Percent changes of the parameters of the aortic stiffness, i.e., 
      deltaPWV, deltaC, and deltaCi, were grouped by every 10% increase in deltaHR. 
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference among groups in deltaPWV, deltaC and 
      deltaCi (p > 0.05 for each of the group). The regression analysis showed no 
      significant correlation of deltaHR with deltaPWV and deltaC (r = 0.18, 0.13 
      respectively, p > 0.05 for each). deltaCi had a poor correlation with deltaHR (r 
      = 0.22, p < 0.05). However, only 4.6% of deltaCi could be referred to deltaHR (r2 
      = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Aortic stiffness was not affected by acute changes in HR 
      produced by isoproterenol which suggests that it is not necessary to consider 
      acute changes in HR when measuring aortic PWV.

TI  - Totally implantable venous access device placement by interventional 
      radiologists: are prophylactic antibiotics necessary?
PG  - 358-62
LID - 10.1016/j.jvir.2011.11.004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the rate of early infection for totally implantable venous 
      access devices (TIVADs) placed without antibiotic prophylaxis. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: A list of patients who underwent TIVAD placement in 2009 was obtained 
      from the patient archiving and communication system (PACS). This list was 
      cross-referenced to all patients who underwent TIVAD removal from January 1, 
      2009, through January 30, 2010, to identify TIVADs that were removed within 30 
      days of placement. Retrospective chart review was performed to record patient 
      demographics, including age, sex, cancer diagnosis, and indication for removal. 
      Concurrent antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, and laboratory data before and 
      within 30 days of placement were recorded. Central line-associated bloodstream 
      infections (CLABSIs) were identified using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention (CDC) criteria. RESULTS: There were 1,183 ports placed and 13 removed. 
      CLABSIs occurred in seven (0.6%) patients within 30 days of placement. At the 
      time of TIVAD placement, 81 (7%) patients were receiving antibiotics incidental 
      to the procedure. One patient who received an antibiotic the day of implantation 
      developed a CLABSI. Chemotherapy was administered to 148 (13%) patients on the 
      day of placement. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of early infection without antibiotic 
      prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is < 1%. 
      Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not 
      recommended.

TI  - Does increasing blood pH stimulate protein synthesis in dialysis patients?
PG  - c276-83
LID - 10.1159/000224795 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the mechanism of muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease 
      is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that acidosis induces 
      muscle protein degradation and could therefore contribute to the loss of muscle 
      protein stores of patients on hemodialysis, a prototypical state of chronic 
      metabolic acidosis (CMA). Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance 
      between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either 
      increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may 
      therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with 
      CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a 
      positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters. METHODS: 
      Eight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium 
      bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic 
      plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +/-1.6 mmol/l. The fractional synthesis 
      rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the 
      L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique. RESULTS: Oral NaHCO(3 
      )supplementation induced a significant increase in serum bicarbonate (21.5 +/- 
      3.4 vs. 28.6 +/- 1.6 mmol/l; p = 0.018) and blood pH (7.41 vs. 7.46; p = 0.041). 
      The FSR of muscle protein and the FSR of albumin did not change significantly 
      (muscle protein: 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5% per day, p = 0.39; albumin: 8.3 +/- 
      2.2 vs. 8.6 +/- 2.5% per day, p = 0.31). Plasma concentrations of insulin-like 
      growth factor 1 decreased significantly (33.4 +/- 21.3 vs. 25.4 +/- 12.3 nmol/l; 
      p = 0.028), whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxin and free 
      triiodothyronine did not change significantly and nutritional parameters showed 
      no improvement. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other findings, raising the blood pH 
      of dialysis patients was not associated with a positive effect on albumin and 
      muscle protein synthesis, or nutritional and endocrinal parameters.

TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy?
PG  - 873-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accepted treatment protocol for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) 
      consists of extensive surgery and wide spectrum antibiotics. Hyperbaric 
      oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving 
      patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF 
      remains controversial. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome 
      in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The 
      mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were 
      compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their 
      treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical 
      excision and antibiotics alone. RESULTS: The two groups were found to be similar 
      with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous 
      prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II 
      score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the 
      HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean 
      number of surgical debridements required per patient was significantly higher in 
      the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although 
      the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO 
      group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of 
      HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for 
      NF.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess pain intensity with and without subcutaneous local anesthesia 
      prior to intraarticular administration of contrast medium for magnetic resonance 
      arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center 
      study was conducted after an IRB waiver of authorization, between January 2010 
      and December 2012. All patients provided written, informed consent for the 
      procedure. Our prospectively populated institutional database was searched, based 
      on our inclusion criteria. There were 249 outpatients (178 men and 71 women; mean 
      age, 44.4 years +/- 14.6; range, 15-79) who underwent MRa and were enrolled in this 
      study. Patients were excluded if they had received surgery of the shoulder before 
      MRa, had undergone repeated MRa of the same shoulder, and/or had undergone MRa of 
      both shoulders on the same day. Patients were randomly assigned into one of three 
      groups. Patients in group A (n=61) received skin infiltration with local 
      anesthesia. Patients in control group B (n=92) and group C (n=96) did not receive 
      local anesthesia. Pain levels were immediately assessed after the injection for 
      MRa using a horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 10. To 
      compare the pain scores of the three groups for male and female patients, a 
      two-way analysis of variance was used. A p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was 
      considered to indicate a significant result. RESULTS: Patients who received local 
      anesthesia (group A) showed a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 +/- 2.3. In 
      patients who did not receive local anesthetics (groups B and C), a mean pain 
      level on the VAS of 2.6 +/- 2.2 and 2.7 +/- 2.4 were detected, respectively. Between 
      the three groups, no statistically significant difference in pain intensity was 
      detected (p=.960). There were significant differences in subjective pain 
      perception between men and women (p=.009). Moreover, the sex difference in all 
      three groups was equal (p=.934). CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia is not required to 
      lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for 
      MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced

TI  - Prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness - does it inevitably progress to Meniere's 
      disease?
PG  - 304-8
LID - 10.1080/00016480601002096 [doi]
AB  - CONCLUSION: We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients 
      suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset 
      and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool. OBJECTIVES: 
      To investigate whether low-tone SD was a precursor of Meniere's disease and 
      whether patients with low-tone SD suffered from endolymphatic hydrops. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case review in the university hospital. A 
      total of 184 patients with low-tone SD were divided into two groups with single 
      and recurrent episodes. The progress, follow-up audiograms, and ECochG results of 
      the patients were reviewed and compared with those of patients with high-tone SD 
      and Meniere's disease. RESULTS: In all, 83 of 177 patients with low-tone SD 
      unaccompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; 15 of the 83 developed 
      vertiginous attacks. The remaining 94 patients had a single episode. Three of the 
      seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing 
      loss; two of the three were subsequently confirmed to have Meniere's disease. The 
      other four had a single episode. No difference in rate of progress from SD to 
      Meniere's disease was observed among the low-tone and the high-tone SD groups. 
      The average -SP/AP of each group with a single episode is smaller than that of 
      other groups with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease.

TI  - Is there a relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded 
      during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation?
PG  - 181-8
LID - 10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.09.062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may require 
      adjunctive methods of substrate modification. Both ablation-targeting complex 
      fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated 
      electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have 
      been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear. METHODS: 
      Twenty patients (age 62 +/- 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control 
      subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 +/- 6 years, 4 males) 
      underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in 
      left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the 
      distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. 
      Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated 
      with SR fractionation. RESULTS: SRF (338 +/- 150 points) and CFAE (418 +/- 135 
      points) regions comprised 29% +/- 14% and 25% +/- 15% of the left atrial surface 
      area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE 
      maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant 
      difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions 
      of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% +/- 13% of the time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: (1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and 
      regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the 
      majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the 
      distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, 
      suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not 
      be a suitable ablation target.

TI  - Is bicompartmental knee arthroplasty more favourable to knee muscle strength and 
      physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty?
PG  - 2532-41
LID - 10.1007/s00167-013-2489-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty features bone and ligament sparing as 
      unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and is presumably better in the recovery of 
      muscle strength and function compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though not 
      previously reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to compare 
      isokinetic knee muscle strength and physical performance in patients who 
      underwent either bicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA. METHODS: Each of 24 
      patients (31 knees) was prospectively examined preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months 
      after each surgery. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength as well as 
      position sense were measured using the Biodex system. Timed up and go test, stair 
      climbing test, and the 6-min walk test were used to assess physical performance. 
      The results of each group were also compared with those from the corresponding 
      healthy control, respectively. RESULTS: Demography showed significant difference 
      in the mean age between bicompartment (54.8 +/- 5.6 years) and TKA groups (65.7 +/- 
      6.7 years). Comparing between the two groups, knee extensor and flexor torque, 
      hamstring/Quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance were not 
      significantly different preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. In 
      intra-group analysis, muscle strength and position sense at each time point were 
      not different in both groups. In physical performance, both groups resulted in 
      improvement in the 6-min walk test, and only TKA group showed enhancement in 
      stair climbing test. CONCLUSIONS: Although theoretically plausible, 
      bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and 
      physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.

TI  - Does pain intensity predict a poor opioid response in cancer patients?
PG  - 713-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.12.020 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that initial pain intensity 
      is not a predictive factor of poor opioid response in advanced cancer patients, 
      as suggested by a recent work. METHODS: A secondary analysis of 
      one-hundred-sixty-seven patients referred for treatment of cancer-related pain 
      was conducted. Pain intensity at admission was recorded and patients were divided 
      in three categories of pain intensity: mild, moderate and severe. Patients were 
      offered a treatment with opioid dose titration, according to department policy. 
      Data regarding opioid doses and pain intensity were collected after dose 
      titration was completed. Four levels of opioid response were considered: (a) good 
      pain control, with minimal opioid escalation and without relevant adverse 
      effects; (b) good pain control requiring more aggressive opioid escalation, for 
      example doubling the doses in four days; (c) adequate pain control associated 
      with the occurrence of adverse effects; (d) poor pain control with adverse 
      effects. RESULTS: Seventy-six, forty-four, forty-one and six patients showed a 
      response a, b, c, and d, respectively. No correlation between baseline pain 
      intensity categories and opioid response was found. Patients with response 'b' 
      and 'd' showed higher values of OEImg. CONCLUSION: Baseline pain intensity does 
      not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that 
      non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.

TI  - Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis 
      on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease?
PG  - 597-601
LID - 10.1007/s00383-012-3094-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The correlation between radiographic transition zone on contrast enema 
      in Hirschsprung's disease and the total length of aganglionosis is known to be 
      inaccurate. The aim of our study was to analyse this correlation more precisely 
      to improve preoperative planning of the corrective surgery. METHODS: From 1998 to 
      2009, 79 patients were operated on for Hirschsprung's disease. All available 
      preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same 
      radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in 
      vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, 
      and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated 
      to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report. RESULTS: Radiological 
      findings were concordant with the specimen in pathology in 8 cases of 19 in 
      rectal form (42 %), in 20 cases of 35 in rectosigmoid form (57 %), in all 6 cases 
      of long-segment form (100 %), in the 2 cases of total colonic form (100 %) with a 
      global agreement of 58.1 %, kappa = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57]. CONCLUSION: Correlation 
      between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of 
      aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or 
      ombilical incision is mandatory.

TI  - Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist?
PG  - 367-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the host immune response to gonorrhoea provides 
      limited serovar specific protection from reinfection. SUBJECTS: 508 episodes of 
      gonorrhoea diagnosed at a city centre genitourinary medicine clinic including 22 
      patients with multiple infections over a 4 year period. METHODS: Patients with 
      recurrent gonococcal infection were analysed with respect to the initial and 
      subsequent serovars isolated. RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in the 
      prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection compared with those 
      without repeat infections. The site of the initial infection did not appear to 
      influence the subsequent serovar isolated. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of 
      serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations 
      with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a 
      quantitatively greater immune response.

TI  - Is calibration the cause of variation in liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry testosterone measurement?
PG  - 368-70
LID - 10.1177/0004563212474563 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Testosterone measurement by liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is well accepted as the preferred technique for the 
      analysis of testosterone. Variation is seen between assays and this may be due to 
      differences in calibration as commercial calibrators for this assay are not 
      readily available. We investigated the effects calibration in routine clinical 
      LC-MS/MS assays. METHODS: All LC-MS/MS users that were registered with the 
      UKNEQAS external quality assurance scheme for testosterone were invited to take 
      part in the study. A set of seven serum samples and serum-based calibrators were 
      sent to all laboratories that expressed an interest. The laboratories were 
      instructed to analyse all samples using there own calibrators and return the 
      results and a method questionnaire for analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen laboratories 
      took part in the study. There was no consensus on supplier of testosterone or 
      matrix for the preparation of calibrators and all were prepared in-house. Also, a 
      wide variety of mass spectrometers, internal standards, chromatography conditions 
      and sample extractions were used. The variation in results did not improve when 
      the results were corrected with a common calibrator. CONCLUSIONS: The variation 
      in results obtained could not be attributed to variations in calibrators. The 
      differences in methodologies between laboratories must be the reason for this 
      variation.

      ultrasound?
PG  - 832-40
LID - 10.1016/j.oooo.2011.11.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of articular 
      sounds, standardized clinical examination, and standardized articular ultrasound 
      in the detection of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Forty patients and 20 asymptomatic volunteers underwent a standardized 
      interview, physical examination, and static and dynamic articular ultrasound. 
      Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated using magnetic 
      resonance as the reference test. RESULTS: A total of 120 temporomandibular joints 
      were examined. Based on our findings, the presence of articular sounds and 
      physical signs are often insufficient to detect disk displacement. Imaging by 
      static and dynamic high-resolution ultrasound demonstrates considerably lower 
      sensitivity when compared with magnetic resonance. Some of the technical 
      difficulties resulted from a limited access because of the presence of 
      surrounding bone structures. CONCLUSIONS: The present study does not support the 
      recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal 
      derangements of the temporomandibular joint.

TI  - Does delivery mode affect women's postpartum quality of life in rural China?
PG  - 1534-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03941.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum 
      quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of 
      life. BACKGROUND: Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, 
      psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of 
      increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery 
      mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study 
      design. METHODS: Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after 
      childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A 
      structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic 
      characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of 
      maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was 
      adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical 
      complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal 
      communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. 
      RESULTS: The overall caeserean section rate was 70.0% (962/1375), and most of 
      them (59.7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total 
      score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with 
      normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit 
      related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male 
      gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery 
      mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural 
      determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Null findings in impact of delivery mode on 
      postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal 
      decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal 
      home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving 
      postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective 
      prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.

TI  - Endovenous laser ablation in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins: 
      does site of access influence early outcomes?
PG  - 310-4
LID - 10.1177/1538574412443316 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was performed to evaluate the clinical and technical 
      efficacy of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of small saphenous varicosities, 
      particularly in relation to the site of endovenous access. METHODS: Totally 59 
      patients with unilateral saphenopopliteal junction incompetence and small 
      saphenous vein reflux underwent EVLA (810 nm, 14 W diode laser) with ambulatory 
      phlebectomies. Small saphenous vein access was gained at the lowest site of 
      truncal reflux. Patients were divided into 2 groups: access gained above mid-calf 
      (AMC, n = 33) and below mid-calf (BMC, n = 26) levels. Outcomes included Venous 
      Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), 
      patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates. RESULTS: Both groups 
      demonstrated significant improvement in VCSS, AVVQ, generic quality of life Short 
      Form 36, and EuroQol scores (P < .05) up to 1 year. No differences were seen 
      between AMC and BMC groups for complications (phlebitis: 2 [6%] and 1 [3.8%], P > 
      .05; paresthesia: 2 [6%] and 5 [19%], P = .223) and recurrence (3 [9%] and 1 
      [3.8%], P = .623), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The site of access in our study 
      does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or 
      recurrence rates.

TI  - Is there a role for fondaparinux in perioperative bridging?
PG  - 36-42
LID - 10.2146/ajhp100133 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the 
      perioperative setting is explored. SUMMARY: Anticoagulation guidelines provide 
      minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's 
      extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging 
      therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, 
      particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial 
      anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be 
      derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and 
      anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for 
      venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided 
      its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case 
      reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one 
      used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. 
      Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations 
      regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For 
      these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In 
      some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. 
      unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited 
      efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or 
      antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for 
      these patients. CONCLUSION: The role of fondaparinux in perioperative bridge 
      therapy has not been established, and there are some important limitations to its 
      use as a routine bridging agent.

TI  - Is it better to be big? The reconfiguration of 21st century hospitals: responses 
      to a hospital merger in Sweden.
PG  - 92-9
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.02.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Swedish hospital mergers seem to stem from a conviction among policy 
      makers that bigger hospitals lead to lower average costs and improved clinical 
      outcomes. The effects of mergers in the form of multisited hospitals have not 
      been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this article is to contribute to 
      this area of knowledge by exploring responses to the merger of Blekinge Hospital. 
      METHODS: The evaluation was guided by the philosophy of triangulation. A 
      questionnaire was sent to 597 randomly selected employees, that is 24% of the 
      health care staff. Four hundred ninety-eight employees answered the 
      questionnaire, giving a response rate of 83%. Furthermore, interviews of 
      different groups of stakeholders were conducted. RESULTS: A moderate increase of 
      quality was assessed, which, a low proportion of the employees perceived had 
      decisively or largely to do with the merger. The majority perceives economical 
      incentives as the drivers of change, but, at the same time, only 10% of this 
      group believes this target was reached completely or to a large extent. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The employees believe the merger has neither generated economy of 
      scale advantages nor substantial quality improvement. Instead, it seems more 
      rewarding to promote cross-functional collaboration together with clinical 
      specialisation. Needs for both integration and differentiation could thereby be 
      fulfilled.

TI  - [Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is 
      pneumologists' skepticism justified?].
PG  - 273-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been 
      shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is 
      transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism 
      of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our 
      study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether 
      cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 
      enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages 
      IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 
      or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was 
      analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight 
      loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and 
      treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the 
      log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. 
      RESULTS: We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 
      61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received 
      cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 
      weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% 
      CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; 
      P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were 
      significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for 
      patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with 
      symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy 
      significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 
      2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that 
      the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not 
      entirely justified.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the extent to which parent-adolescent emotional closeness, 
      family conflict, and parental permissiveness moderate the association of puberty 
      and alcohol use in adolescents (aged 10-14). METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 
      7631 adolescents from 231 Australian schools. Measures included pubertal status, 
      recent (30day) alcohol use, parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family 
      conflict, parental permissiveness of alcohol use and peer alcohol use. The 
      analysis was based on a two-level (individuals nested within schools) logistic 
      regression model, with main effects entered first, and interaction terms added 
      second. RESULTS: The interaction of family factors and pubertal stage did not 
      improve the fit of the model, so a main effect model of family factors and 
      pubertal stage was adopted. There were significant main effects for pubertal 
      stage with boys in middle puberty at increased odds of alcohol use, and girls in 
      advanced puberty at increased odds of alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: Puberty and 
      family factors were strong predictors of adolescent alcohol use, but family 
      factors did not account for variation in the association of pubertal stage and 
      alcohol use.

TI  - Does increased use of private health care reduce the demand for NHS care? A 
      prospective survey of general practice referrals.
PG  - 182-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of the private sector for health care is increasing, but it 
      is unclear whether this will reduce demand on the NHS. The aim of this study was 
      to examine the relationship between private and NHS outpatient referral rates 
      accounting for their association with deprivation. METHODS: This is a prospective 
      survey of general practitioner referrals to private and NHS consultant-led 
      services between 1 January and 31 December 2001 from 10 general practices in the 
      Trent Focus Collaborative Research Network, United Kingdom. Patient referrals 
      were aggregated to give private and NHS referral rates for each electoral ward in 
      each practice. RESULTS: Of 17,137 referrals, 90.4 percent (15,495) were to the 
      NHS and 9.6 percent (1642) to the private sector. Private referral rates were 
      lower in patients from the most deprived fifth of wards compared with the least 
      deprived fifth (rate ratio 0.25, 95 percent CI 0.15 to 0.41, p < 0.001), whereas 
      NHS referral rates were slightly higher in patients in the most deprived fifth of 
      wards (rate ratio 1.18, 95 percent CI 0.98 to 1.42, p = 0.08) both after age 
      standardisation and adjustment for practice. The NHS referral rate was 
      significantly higher (rate ratio 1.40, 95 percent CI 1.15 to 1.71, p = 0.001) in 
      wards with private referral rates in the top fifth compared with the bottom fifth 
      after adjustment for deprivation and practice. CONCLUSIONS: Increased private 
      health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private 
      referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for 
      age, deprivation and practice.

TI  - Is decompressive surgery effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with 
      compressive cervical myelopathy?
PG  - E1290-7
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181e6d592 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective multicenter study of series of 12 patients with 
      spinal cord sarcoidosis who underwent surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      postoperative outcomes of patients with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis 
      accompanied with compressive myelopathy and effect of decompressive surgery on 
      the prognosis of sarcoidosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sarcoidosis is a 
      chronic, multisystem noncaseating granulomatous disease. It is difficult to 
      differentiate spinal cord sarcoidosis from cervical compressive myelopathy. There 
      are no studies regarding the coexistence of compressive cervical myelopathy with 
      cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis and the effect of decompressive surgery. 
      METHODS: Nagoya Spine Group database included 1560 cases with cervical myelopathy 
      treated with cervical laminectomy or laminoplasty from 2001 to 2005. A total of 
      12 patients (0.08% of cervical myelopathy) were identified spinal cord 
      sarcoidosis treated with decompressive surgery. As a control subject, 8 patients 
      with spinal cord sarcoidosis without compressive lesion who underwent high-dose 
      steroid therapy without surgery were recruited. RESULTS: In the surgery group, 
      enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were mostly seen at C5-C6, 
      coincident with the maximum compression level in all cases. Postoperative 
      recovery rates in the surgery group at 1 week and 4 weeks were -7.4% and -1.1%, 
      respectively. Only 5 cases had showed clinical improvement, and the condition of 
      these 5 patients had worsened again at averaged 7.4 weeks after surgery. 
      Postoperative oral steroid therapy was initiated at an average of 6.4 weeks and 
      the average initial dose was 54.0 mg in the surgery group, while 51.3 mg in the 
      nonsurgery group. The recovery rate of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, 
      which increased after steroid therapy, was better in the nonsurgery group (62.5%) 
      than in the surgery group (18.6%) with significant difference (P < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: The effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with 
      compressive myelopathy was not evident. Early diagnosis for sarcoidosis from 
      other organ and steroid therapy should be needed.

TI  - Does the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites result in 
      serious acute side effects?
PG  - 88-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and severity of acute side effects from the 
      use of polyvalent antivenin in victims of rattlesnake bites. DESIGN: We 
      retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who presented with 
      rattlesnake bites to a university teaching hospital during an 11-year period. 
      From patient medical records, we extracted demographic data, clinical 
      measurements, and outcomes during emergency department evaluation and subsequent 
      hospitalization. Data regarding serum sickness were not collected. OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Primary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate 
      hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent 
      disability at hospital discharge, and mortality. RESULTS: We identified a total 
      of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation 
      was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); 
      moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 
      patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per 
      patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 
      or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin 
      given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 
      (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3). No deaths, amputations, or permanent 
      disability from snakebite occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. Acute 
      side effects of antivenin-occurring within the first 6 hours after 
      administration-were seen in 12 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-30%). 
      Acute side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but 1 patient (2%; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0%-8%). This patient had a history of previous antivenin 
      reaction and required a short course of intravenous epinephrine for blood 
      pressure support. No other complications occurred. CONCLUSION: The administration 
      of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it 
      occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are 
      uncommon.

TI  - Does successful completion of the Perinatal Education Programme result in 
      improved obstetric practice?
PG  - 180-2, 184, 187
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether successful completion of the Perinatal Education 
      Programme (PEP) improves obstetric practice. METHOD: The three midwife obstetric 
      units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two 
      MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design 
      was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes 
      occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected 
      at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the 
      patient had delivered. OUTCOME MEASURES: We ascertained whether the obstetric 
      history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and 
      uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether 
      appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, 
      the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, 
      evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of 
      contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate 
      actions were taken, were assessed. RESULTS: Eight of the 13 midwives at the two 
      MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case 
      notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change 
      in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The 
      obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory 
      response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 
      12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no 
      difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% 
      of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a 
      problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% 
      of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was 
      ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom 
      performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done 
      and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of 
      contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No 
      differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, 
      appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. 
      CONCLUSION: Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge 
      of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to 
      employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This 
      study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out 
      a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring 
      it more in line with current evidence. METHODS: The use of prophylactic 
      nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for 
      the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra 
      Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice 
      was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second 
      review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two 
      periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use. RESULTS: Twenty two 
      patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and 
      November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and 
      February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the 
      pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 
      21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic 
      NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups 
      was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that mailing 
      out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not 
      sufficient to lead to a change in practice.

TI  - Kell alloimmunization in pregnancy: associated with fetal thrombocytopenia?
PG  - 66-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1423-0410.2008.01061.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kell haemolytic disease in pregnancies has been 
      suggested to be associated with decreased fetal platelet counts. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of fetal 
      thrombocytopenia in pregnancies complicated by Kell alloimmunization. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, fetal platelet counts were 
      performed in 42 pregnancies with severe Kell alloimmunization prior to the first 
      intrauterine blood transfusion. Platelet counts from 318 first intrauterine 
      transfusions in RhD alloimmunized pregnancies were used as controls. RESULTS: 
      Fetal thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 x 10(9)/l) was found in 4/42 (10%) 
      in the Kell group and in 84/318 (26%) in the RhD group. None of the fetuses in 
      the Kell alloimmunized pregnancies, including 15 with severe hydrops, had a 
      clinically significant thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count < 50 x 
      10(9)/l. In the RhD alloimmunized pregnancies, 2/230 (1%) of the non-hydropic 
      fetuses and 7/30 (23%) of the severely hydropic fetuses had a clinically 
      significant thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: In contrast to fetuses with severe 
      anaemia and hydrops due to RhD alloimmunization, fetuses with severe anaemia due 
      to Kell alloimmunization are generally not at risk for substantial 
      thrombocytopenia.

TI  - Globulomaxillary cysts--do they really exist?
PG  - 239-46
LID - 10.1007/s00784-013-0954-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The so-called "globulomaxillary cyst", described as a fissural cyst, 
      caused by entrapped epithelium between the nasal and maxillary process, is no 
      longer considered for its own entity. Nevertheless, cystic lesions, which 
      correspond to the previous image of globulomaxillary cysts, do still occur in 
      daily practice. This raises the question to which entities pathological processes 
      in this particular region actually belong to. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 
      retrospective study, 17 cases (12 men and 5 women, 12-59 years old) of primarily 
      diagnosed globulomaxillary cysts are analysed according to clinical, radiological 
      and histological aspects, catamnestic processed and assigned to a new entity. The 
      results are compared with the international literature and draws conclusions on 
      the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. RESULTS: Seven lateral periodontal 
      cysts, four radicular cysts, two keratocystic odontogenic tumours, one 
      adenomatoid odontogenic tumour, one periapical granuloma, one residual cyst and 
      one undefined jaw cyst were determined. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of 
      our study and the data from the international literature, the entity 
      globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.

TI  - Colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: does global management at 
      the same centre improve results?

LID - S2210-7401(12)00043-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clinre.2012.02.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Synchronous liver metastases (SLM) occur in 20% of colorectal cancers 
      (CRC). Resection of SLM and CLC can be undertaken at different centres (separate 
      management, SM) or at the same centre (global management, GM). METHODS: 
      Retrospective study of SLM and CRC resections carried out during 01/2000 - 
      12/2006 by SM or GM, using a combined or delayed strategy. RESULTS: Morphologic 
      characteristics and type of CRC and SLM resection were similar for the GM (n = 
      45) or SM (n = 66) groups. In patients with delayed liver resection (62 SM, 17 
      GM), chemotherapy prior to liver surgery was used in 92% and 38% of SM and GM 
      patients (P < 0.0001) and the median delay between procedures was 212 and 182 
      days, respectively (P = 0.04). First step of liver resection was more often 
      performed during colorectal surgery in the GM group (62 vs. 6% for SM, P < 
      0.0001) and the mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower (1.6 vs. 2.3, P = 
      0.003). Three-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). Overall 
      survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% 
      at 5 years (n.s.). Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in SM patients 
      (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: GM of CRC and SLM was associated with 
      fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a 
      longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting 
      that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher 
      disease-free survival after SLM resection.

TI  - Are octogenarians at high risk for carotid endarterectomy?
PG  - 549-53
LID - 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2008.05.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several prospective randomized trials have proved carotid 
      endarterectomy to be safe and effective for both symptomatic and asymptomatic 
      patients younger than 80 years of age. Recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) 
      has been approved for use in selected high-risk patients. It has been proposed 
      that being an octogenarian places patients in this high-risk category. STUDY 
      DESIGN: All patients between the ages of 80 to 89 years undergoing carotid 
      endarterectomy during a 12-year period were included in the study. Information 
      included indications for carotid endarterectomy, associated risk factors, length 
      of stay, and hospital course. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, including 
      neurologic events and myocardial infarction, were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 
      103 carotid endarterectomies were performed in 95 octogenarians. Procedures were 
      performed on 59 men and 36 women. Indications for operation included symptomatic 
      carotid stenosis in 44 patients (43%) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis in 59 
      (57%). Associated risk factors included diabetes mellitus (17%), hypertension 
      (76%), coronary artery disease (28%), hyperlipidemia (39%), and history of 
      smoking (42%). There were 4 perioperative neurologic complications, which 
      included 1 transient ischemic attack (0.97%), 2 minor strokes (1.94%), and 1 
      major stroke (0.97%). There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Combined end points for 
      adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains 
      the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age 
      groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid 
      endarterectomy.

TI  - Is there a need for pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma?
PG  - 13-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the necessity of pelvic computed tomography (CT) in 
      patients of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the 
      records of 400 patients of RCC, who underwent treatment at our institution 
      between January 1988 and February 2001. These patients were evaluated 
      pre-operatively with ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast enhanced CT scan of the 
      abdomen and pelvis. USG or CT scans of these cases were reviewed for presence of 
      pathology in the pelvis, which were classified into 3 categories viz; benign and 
      likely to be insignificant, benign and likely to be significant; and malignant. 
      RESULTS: Of the 400 cases, 114 were stage I, 68 were stage II, 99 were stage III 
      and 119 were stage IV. In all patients, tumour was identified in the kidney on 
      preoperative CT scan. Fourteen patients (3.5%) had an abnormality on pelvic CT. 
      Five (1.25%) had category 1, three (0.75%) had category 2 and six (1.5%) had 
      category 3 abnormality on pelvic CT. However, all these abnormalities in pelvis 
      were detected prior to CT by other investigations (USG or plain x-ray). Of the 
      six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had 
      RCC in a pelvic kidney and three had bone metastases in the pelvis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pelvic CT does not offer additional information in the vast majority of cases 
      with RCC and should be performed selectively. Thus the cost of diagnostic imaging 
      in RCC can be reduced.

TI  - [Should circumcision be performed in childhood?].
PG  - 807-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prepuce development and retractibility in a group of boys. 
      To point out the value of circumcision and prepucial forced dilation during 
      childhood. METHODS: Prepuce development and retractibility were evaluated in 400 
      boys ages between 0-16 year old. RESULTS: In boys under 1 year prepuce 
      retractibility (assessed only in children who did not undergo forced dilation 
      previously) was type I (non retractile) in 71.5% whereas type V (completely 
      retractile) was only 5.5%. In adolescent boys type I prepuce was observed in 1 
      boy only, 1.6%, whereas type V was observed in 82.3%. Furthermore, it was 
      observed that at the time of examination for the study 106 boys who had undergone 
      forced dilation at an earlier age had balano-prepucial adhesions again, which 
      demonstrates that prepuce adheres again to glans penis in many boys after a 
      forced dilation is performed. Only 11 boys were considered in need for 
      circumcision, three of them for prepucial orifice stenosis, which prevented 
      normal micturition, causing a prepucial sac, one case due to a constrictive ring 
      below the prepucial edge that would have prevented ulterior retractability, two 
      cases with repetitive balanopostitis, and five cases secondary to xerosol 
      balanitis, accounting for 2.7% of all examined boys. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete 
      separation between prepuce and glans penis is normal and common among new-borns, 
      progressing until adolescence to spontaneous separation, at which time it is 
      complete in the majority of boys. Accordingly to the criteria we have sustained 
      for years and present study's findings, circumcision has few indications during 
      childhood, as well as forced prepucial dilation.

TI  - Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of 
      Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection?

LID - S1878-8750(16)31081-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2016.10.092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between the use of an endoscope during 
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) procedures and infection remains poorly defined. 
      In this study, we sought to analyze whether the simultaneous use of an endoscope 
      could in fact increase the infection rate associated with VPS procedures. 
      METHODS: This study included 438 VPS procedures, 49 in which an endoscope was 
      used (11.2%) and 389 in which an endoscope was not used (88.8%). The infection 
      rates in these 2 main groups were calculated and compared. Subsequently, 4 new 
      groups were created, composed of patients with a shunt inserted for the first 
      time (groups 1A and 1B) and patients with a shunt reviewed or inserted for a 
      second time (groups 2A and 2B). Groups 1A and 2A comprised patients in whom an 
      endoscope was used simultaneously with VPS surgery, and groups 1B and 2B 
      comprised patients in whom an endoscope was not used. These groups were compared 
      to determine the infection rate. RESULTS: The overall infection rate was 18.5%, 
      including 22.4% in the groups in which an endoscope was used and 18% in those in 
      which an endoscope was not used (P = 0.449). Groups 1A and 1B and groups 2A and 
      2B were matched for possible intervening risk factors. The infection rate was 
      28.6% in group 1A and 16.2% in group 1B (P = 0.27), and 20% in group 2A and 19.8% 
      in group 2B (P = 0.977). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the use of an 
      endoscope during VPS procedures did not increase the risk of surgical infection.

TI  - Is the probability of prenatal diagnosis or termination of pregnancy different 
      for fetuses with congenital anomalies conceived following assisted reproductive 
      techniques? A population-based evaluation of fetuses with congenital heart 
      defects.
PG  - 924-31
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.13345 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the probability of prenatal diagnosis (PND) and termination 
      of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) between fetuses conceived by assisted 
      reproductive techniques (ART) and spontaneously-conceived fetuses with congenital 
      heart defects (CHD). DESIGN: Population-based observational study. SETTING: Paris 
      and surrounding suburbs. POPULATION: Fetuses with CHD in the Paris registry of 
      congenital malformations and cohort of children with CHD (Epicard). METHODS: 
      Comparison of ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses taking into 
      account potential confounders (maternal characteristics, multiplicity and year of 
      birth or TOPFA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Probability and gestational age at PND 
      and TOPFA for ART-conceived versus spontaneously conceived fetuses. RESULTS: The 
      probability of PND (28.1% versus 34.6%, P = 0.077) and TOPFA (36.2% versus 39.2%, 
      P = 0.677) were not statistically different between ART-conceived (n = 171) and 
      spontaneously conceived (n = 4620) fetuses. Estimates were similar after 
      adjustment for potential confounders. Gestational age at PND tended to be earlier 
      for ART fetuses (23.1 versus 24.8 weeks, P = 0.05) but no statistical difference 
      was found after adjustment for confounders. Gestational age at TOPFA was 
      comparable between ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our population, ART conception was not significantly associated 
      with the probability of PND or TOPFA for CHD. One implication of our results is 
      that live births may be adequate for assessing the overall risk of CHD related to 
      ART. However, total prevalence, in particular of severe CHD, would not be 
      adequately assessed if TOPFA are not included.

TI  - Is There an Additional Value of Using Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 2a 
      Immunohistochemistry Compared to Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy Uptake in 
      Predicting Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Response?
PG  - 560-6
LID - 10.1159/000441604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is unknown whether tumoral somatostatin receptor subtype 
      2a (sst2a) immunohistochemistry (IHC) has additional value compared to 
      somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) uptake using OctreoScan(R) in predicting 
      response to peptide receptor radiotherapy using 177Lu-octreotate (PRRT) in 
      patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). The aims 
      of this study were: (1) to establish the percentage of sst2a immunopositivity in 
      GEP-NET samples of PRRT-treated patients, (2) to determine the relationship 
      between best GEP-NET response using RECIST 1.0 criteria 1 year after PRRT and 
      tumoral sst2a IHC, and (3) to compare characteristics of patients with sst2a 
      IHC-negative and -positive tumors. METHODS: All 73 consecutive patients were 
      selected for PRRT based on a positive SRS. Radiological response was scored 
      according to RECIST 1.0 criteria. sst2a status was detected on tumor samples by 
      IHC. RESULTS: In total, 93% of GEP-NET samples showed sst2a IHC positivity. No 
      statistically significant relationship was observed between in vitro sst2a 
      expression and in vivo best GEP-NET response 1 year after PRRT (p = 0.47). Sex, 
      primary tumor site, disease stage, ENETS TNM classification, Ki-67 index, highest 
      serum chromogranin-A level, and highest neuron-specific enolase level were not 
      significantly different between patients with negative and positive sst2a tumoral 
      IHC with the exception of age at diagnosis (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: sst2a IHC of 
      tumor samples has no additional value compared to SRS uptake using OctreoScan(R) in 
      predicting tumor response after PRRT.

TI  - Does growth hormone replacement therapy reduce mortality in adults with growth 
      hormone deficiency? Data from the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone 
      Treatment in adults.
PG  - 3151-9
LID - 10.1210/jc.2011-1215 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Adults with GH deficiency (GHD) have a decreased life expectancy. The 
      effect of GH treatment on mortality remains to be established. OBJECTIVE: This 
      nationwide cohort study investigates the effect of GH treatment on all-cause and 
      cause-specific mortality and analyzes patient characteristics influencing 
      mortality in GHD adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients in the Dutch 
      National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults were retrospectively 
      monitored (1985-2009) and subdivided into treatment (n = 2229), primary 
      (untreated, n = 109), and secondary control (partly treated, n = 356) groups. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for 
      all-cause, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Expected 
      mortality was obtained from cause, sex, calendar year, and age-specific death 
      rates from national death and population counts. RESULTS: In the treatment group, 
      95 patients died compared to 74.6 expected [SMR 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 
      1.04-1.56)]. Mortality was higher in women than in men. After exclusion of 
      high-risk patients, the SMR for CVD mortality remained increased in women. 
      Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated. In the control groups mortality 
      was not different from the background population. Univariate analyses 
      demonstrated sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis as influencing 
      factors. CONCLUSIONS: GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not 
      different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk 
      patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for 
      CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH 
      treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on 
      mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.

TI  - Can decisional algorithms replace global introspection in the individual 
      causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs?
PG  - 697-702
AB  - AIM: The usefulness of algorithms for assessing the causality of suspected 
      adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has yet to be established and, since the validation 
      of causality algorithms depends upon their sensitivity and specificity, our study 
      was carried out to evaluate these measures. METHOD: In this study, an expert 
      panel assessed causality of adverse reports by using the WHO global introspection 
      (GI) method. The same reports were independently assessed using 15 published 
      algorithms. The causality assessment level 'possible' was considered the lower 
      limit for a report to be considered to be drug related. For a given algorithm, 
      sensitivity was determined by the proportion of reports simultaneously classified 
      as drug related by the algorithm and the GI method. Specificity was measured as 
      the proportion of reports simultaneously considered non-drug related. The 
      analysis was performed for the total sample and within serious or unexpected 
      events. RESULTS: Five hundred adverse reports were studied. Algorithms presented 
      high rates of sensitivity (average of 93%, positive predictive value of 89%) and 
      low rates of specificity (average of 7%, negative predictive value of 31%). 
      CONCLUSION: Decisional algorithms are sensitive methods for the detection of 
      ADRs, but they present poor specificity. A reference method was not identified. 
      Algorithms do not replace GI and are not definite alternatives in the individual 
      causality assessment of suspected ADRs.

TI  - Sternal skin conductance: a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement?
PG  - 1164-8
LID - 10.1097/GME.0b013e31828cec53 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the accuracy of a new sternal skin 
      conductance (SSC) device in measuring hot flashes and to assess the acceptability 
      of the device by women. METHODS: Three small descriptive pilot studies were 
      performed using two sequential prototypes of the SSC device developed by an 
      engineering device company in the Midwest. The devices were worn either in a 
      monitored setting for 24 hours or in an ambulatory setting for 5 weeks. During 
      the study period, women recorded hot flashes in a prospective hot flash diary and 
      answered questions about the acceptability of wearing the SSC device. RESULTS: 
      The first prototype was not able to collect any analyzable skin conductance data 
      owing to various malfunction issues, including poor conductance and battery 
      failure. However, 16 women wore the device for 5 weeks and reported that wearing 
      the device was acceptable, although 31% stated that it interfered with daily 
      activities. Hot flash data from the second prototype revealed a 24% concordance 
      rate between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings 
      from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported 
      hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC 
      monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency 
      in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying 
      issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate 
      measure for hot flashes.

TI  - Is the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire useful for the 
      screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men?
PG  - 365-8
LID - 10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.04.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen serum levels significantly decrease in older men, causing 
      quality of life impairment and increasing the risk of chronic disease. This 
      disorder is defined as PADAM (Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men). 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a PADAM screening tool and determine the prevalence of 
      this disorder in healthy adult men. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in 
      which 96 men aged 40 or more of the South Metropolitan Region of Santiago de 
      Chile were surveyed with the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) 
      questionnaire of the Saint Louis University and sampled for the serum 
      determination of total testosterone, sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and 
      albumin. Also free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. PADAM was 
      considered present if items 1 or 7 or any 3 other questions of the ADAM 
      questionnaire were positive. An available testosterone of <198.4 ng/dL was used 
      as a gold standard for the diagnosis of PADAM. RESULTS: A total of 78 men (81.3%) 
      were identified as possible PADAM according to the ADAM questionnaire. Total 
      testosterone levels fell from 503.6+/-180.1 ng/dL in men aged 40 to 54 years to 
      382.1+/-247.3 in those >70 years; however this was not statistically significant 
      (ANOVA, p=0.06). In the same age groups, SHBG significantly increased 
      (31.0+/-15.0 to 47.5+/-15.0 nmol/L, p<0.001) whereas free and available 
      testosterone significantly decreased (10.6+/-3.2 to 6.4+/-3.6 ng/dL and 
      266.6+/-81.2 to 152.2+/-97.6 ng/dL, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall (n=96), 
      available testosterone confirmed PADAM diagnosis in 27 cases (28.1%). The ADAM 
      tool rendered a 83.3% sensitivity and 19.7% specificity in the detection of 
      PADAM. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) was a better predictor of hypogonadism 
      than the complete questionnaire (63.3% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity). 
      CONCLUSION: In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the 
      prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire 
      rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically 
      suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.

TI  - Does a history of unintended pregnancy lessen the likelihood of desire for 
      sterilization reversal?
PG  - 501-6
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2012.3885 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unintended pregnancy has been significantly associated with 
      subsequent female sterilization. Whether women who are sterilized after 
      experiencing an unintended pregnancy are less likely to express desire for 
      sterilization reversal is unknown. METHODS: This study used national, 
      cross-sectional data collected by the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth. 
      The study sample included women ages 15-44 who were surgically sterile from a 
      tubal sterilization at the time of interview. Multivariable logistic regression 
      was used to examine the relationship between a history of unintended pregnancy 
      and desire for sterilization reversal while controlling for potential 
      confounders. RESULTS: In this nationally representative sample of 1,418 women who 
      were sterile from a tubal sterilization, 78% had a history of at least one 
      unintended pregnancy and 28% expressed a desire to have their sterilization 
      reversed. In unadjusted analysis, having a prior unintended pregnancy was 
      associated with higher odds of expressing desire for sterilization reversal (odds 
      ratio [OR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.79). In adjusted analysis 
      controlling for sociodemographic factors, unintended pregnancy was no longer 
      significantly associated with desire for reversal (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.91-2.34). 
      CONCLUSION: Among women who had undergone tubal sterilization, a prior history of 
      unintended pregnancy did not decrease desire for sterilization reversal.

TI  - Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp 
      biomicroscopy method?
PG  - 1637-47
LID - 10.1007/s00417-011-1909-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this work is to assess a previously described slit-lamp 
      biomicroscopy-based method (SLBM) for measuring pupil diameter and compare it to 
      Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP). METHODS: Two examiners performed three 
      repeated measurements with each instrument in 40 healthy eyes. We determined the 
      agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and 
      interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 
      6.0 mm. RESULTS: The mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 +/- 
      0.70 mm with SLBM and 6.26 +/- 0.68 mm with CIP (p = 0.01) averaging both 
      examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60 mm and 
      -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p = 0.02), 
      and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver 
      reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30 mm. The ICCs 
      were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver 
      reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09 mm. Kappa 
      statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, 
      and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of 
      SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6 mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and 
      from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively. The best trade-off between sensitivity and 
      specificity ranged from 5.4 mm to 6.2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Although the SLBM is quite 
      repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of 
      agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 
      6 mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous 
      grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, 
      and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the 
      SLBM.

TI  - Does stress increase imitation of drinking behavior? An experimental study in a 
      (semi-)naturalistic context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: That alcohol consumption is strongly influenced by the drinking 
      behavior of social company has been demonstrated in observational research. 
      However, not everyone is equally vulnerable to other people's drinking, and it is 
      important to unravel which factors underlie these individual differences. This 
      study focuses on the role of psychosocial stress in attempting to explain 
      individual differences in the propensity to imitate alcohol consumption. METHODS: 
      With a 2 (confederate's drinking condition: alcohol vs. soda) x 2 (participant's 
      stress condition: stress vs. no stress) experimental design, we tested whether 
      the tendency to imitate other people's drinking was related to participants' 
      induced stress levels. The young male adults (N = 106) were randomly assigned to 
      each of the conditions. In each session, directly after the stress or no-stress 
      period, confederates and participants entered a bar laboratory where we observed 
      their drinking behavior. Prior to entering the session, confederates were 
      instructed to drink alcohol or soda. RESULTS: Participants in both stress and 
      no-stress conditions consumed substantially more alcohol when confederates drank 
      alcohol than when they drank soda. There was no difference in alcohol consumed 
      between stress and no-stress conditions. No moderating effect of stress on the 
      tendency to drink along with peers was found. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, it appears 
      that among young male adults, imitation of alcohol consumption is a robust 
      phenomenon not dependent on individual stress levels.

TI  - Do clinical variables predict pathologic radiographs in the first episode of 
      wheezing?
PG  - 8-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical variables assessed in relation to Albuterol 
      aerosol treatments accurately identify children with pathologic radiographs 
      during their initial episode of bronchospasm. METHODS: A prospective convenience 
      sample of children with a first episode of wheezing. Data collected included 
      demographics, baseline and post-treatment clinical score and physical 
      examination, number of aerosols, requirement for supplemental oxygen, and 
      disposition. Chest radiographs were obtained and interpreted, and patients were 
      divided into 2 groups based on a pathologic versus nonpathologic radiograph 
      interpretation. Chi2 testing was performed for categoric variables, and the 
      student t test was performed for continuous variables. A discriminant analysis 
      was used to develop a model. RESULTS: Pathologic radiographs were identified in 
      61 patients (9%). Between groups, a significant difference was noted for 
      pretreatment oxygen saturation only. Clinical score, respiratory rate, and 
      presence of rales both pretreatment and posttreatment were not significantly 
      different between groups. The discriminant analysis correctly predicted 90% of 
      nonpathologic radiographs but only 15% of pathologic radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not 
      identify all children with pathologic radiographs.

TI  - Is distance to provider a barrier to care for medicaid patients with breast, 
      colorectal, or lung cancer?
PG  - 54-62
LID - 10.1111/j.1748-0361.2011.00371.x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Distance to provider might be an important barrier to timely diagnosis 
      and treatment for cancer patients who qualify for Medicaid coverage. Whether 
      driving time or driving distance is a better indicator of travel burden is also 
      of interest. METHODS: Driving distances and times from patient residence to 
      primary care provider were calculated for 3,917 breast, colorectal (CRC) and lung 
      cancer Medicaid patients in Washington State from 1997 to 2003 using 
      MapQuest.com. We fitted regression models of stage at diagnosis and 
      time-to-treatment (number of days between diagnosis and surgery) to test the 
      hypothesis that travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment 
      of cancer. FINDINGS: Later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer Medicaid patients 
      is associated with travel burden (OR = 1.488 per 100 driving miles, P= .037 and 
      OR = 1.270 per driving hour, P= .016). Time-to-treatment after diagnosis of CRC 
      is also associated with travel burden (14.57 days per 100 driving miles, P= .002 
      and 5.86 days per driving hour, P= .018). CONCLUSIONS: Although travel burden is 
      associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did 
      not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting 
      timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More 
      intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC 
      for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.

TI  - Laminoplasty outcomes: is there a difference between patients with degenerative 
      stenosis and those with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament?
PG  - E9
LID - 10.3171/2011.1.FOCUS10279 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Two common causes of cervical myelopathy include degenerative stenosis 
      and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). It has been 
      postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes 
      than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical 
      results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due 
      to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL. METHODS: The authors conducted 
      a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a 
      single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without 
      kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy 
      ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL 
      group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and 
      number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p > 0.05). The 
      authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic 
      results. RESULTS: The overall clinical follow-up rate was 88%, and the mean 
      clinical follow-up duration was 16.4 months. The mean radiographic follow-up rate 
      was 83%, and the mean length of radiographic follow-up was 9.3 months. There were 
      no significant differences in the estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of 
      hospital stay (LOS) between the groups (p > 0.05). The mean EBL and LOS for the 
      degenerative group were 206 ml and 3.7 days, respectively. The mean EBL and LOS 
      for the OPLL group were 155 ml and 4 days, respectively. There was a 
      statistically significant improvement of more than one grade in the Nurick score 
      for both groups following surgery (p < 0.05). The Nurick score improvement was 
      not statistically different between the groups (p > 0.05). The visual analog 
      scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively 
      (p > 0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between 
      groups either (p > 0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of 
      motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically 
      significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CSM due to either degenerative 
      disease or segmental OPLL have similar perioperative results and neurological 
      outcomes with laminoplasty. The VAS neck pain scores did not improve 
      significantly with laminoplasty for either group. Laminoplasty may limit 
      extension ROM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare growth curves of body mass index from children to 
      adolescents, and then to young adults, in Japanese girls and women in birth 
      cohorts born from 1930 to 1999. DESIGN: Retrospective repeated cross sectional 
      annual nationwide surveys (national nutrition survey, Japan) carried out from 
      1948 to 2005. SETTING: Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 76,635 females from 1 to 25 years of 
      age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Body mass index. RESULTS: Generally, body mass index 
      decreased in preschool children (2-5 years), increased in children (6-12 years) 
      and adolescents (13-18 years), and slightly decreased in young adults (19-25 
      years) in these Japanese females. However, the curves differed among birth 
      cohorts. More recent cohorts were more overweight as children but thinner as 
      young women. The increments in body mass index in early childhood were larger in 
      more recent cohorts than in older cohorts. However, the increments in body mass 
      index in adolescents were smaller and the decrease in body mass index in young 
      adults started earlier, with lower peak values in more recent cohorts than in 
      older cohorts. The decrements in body mass index in young adults were similar in 
      all birth cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: An overweight birth cohort in childhood does not 
      necessarily continue to be overweight in young adulthood. Not only secular trends 
      in body mass index at fixed ages but also growth curves for wide age ranges by 
      birth cohorts should be considered to study obesity and thinness. Growth curves 
      by birth cohorts were produced by a repeated cross sectional annual survey over 
      nearly six decades.

TI  - Does patient position during liver surgery influence the risk of venous air 
      embolism?
PG  - 366-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally believed that positioning of the patient in a 
      head-down tilt (Trendelenberg position) decreases the likelihood of a venous air 
      embolism during liver resection. METHODS: The physiological effect of variation 
      in horizontal attitude on central and hepatic venous pressure was measured in 10 
      patients during liver surgery. Hemodynamic indices were recorded with the 
      operating table in the horizontal, 20 degrees head-up and 20 degrees head-down 
      positions. RESULTS: There was no demonstrable pressure gradient between the 
      hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions. The absolute pressures 
      did, however, vary in a predictable way, being highest in the head-down and 
      lowest during head-up tilt. However, on no occasion was a negative intraluminal 
      pressure recorded. CONCLUSION: The effect on venous pressures caused by the 
      change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk 
      of venous air embolism.

TI  - Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary?: A 
      prospective study of 350 cases.
PG  - 1561-4
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVE: Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) 
      with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) occurs in 1 to 6% of cases. Routine chest 
      radiography (CXR) following TBB is therefore requested by most pulmonologists in 
      an attempt to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax. The objective of 
      this study was to determine if routine CXR after bronchoscopy and TBB is 
      necessary. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study group included 350 consecutive patients 
      who underwent FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 
      2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 h after the procedure in all cases. 
      Additionally, the following information was recorded in all patients: sex, age, 
      immune status, indication for bronchoscopy, total number of biopsies done, 
      segment sampled, pulse oxygen saturation, and development of symptoms suggestive 
      of pneumothorax. RESULTS: Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiologically in 10 
      patients (2.9%). Seven patients had symptoms strongly suggestive of pneumothorax 
      prior to CXR, including four patients with large (> 10%) pneumothorax. The other 
      three patients were asymptomatic, with only minimal pneumothorax (</= 10%), which 
      resolved completely 24 to 48 h later. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that routine CXR 
      after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms 
      suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and 
      usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.

TI  - Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome?
PG  - 714-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested a protective effect of folic acid (FA) 
      on congenital heart anomalies. Down syndrome (DS) infants are known to have a 
      high frequency of heart anomalies. Not all children with DS suffer from heart 
      anomalies, which raises the question whether maternal factors might affect the 
      risk of these anomalies. Our objectives were to investigate whether 
      first-trimester FA use protects against heart anomalies among DS children. 
      METHODS: Women with liveborn DS children participating in the Slone Epidemiology 
      Center Birth Defects Study between 1976 and 1997 were included. We performed 
      case-control analyses using DS, with heart anomalies as cases and DS, without 
      heart anomalies as controls. Subanalyses were performed for defects that have 
      been associated with FA in non-DS populations (conotruncal, ventricular septal 
      [VSD]) and for those that are associated with DS (ostium secundum type atrial 
      septal defects [ASD] and endocardial cushion defects [ECD]). Exposure was defined 
      as the use of any FA-containing product for an average of at least 4 days per 
      week during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, whereas no exposure was defined as 
      no use of FA in these 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 223 cases, 110 (49%) were exposed 
      versus 84 (46%) of the 184 controls. After adjustment for possible confounders, 
      no protective effect of FA was found on heart anomalies overall (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 
      0.61-1.47) nor separately for conotruncal defects, VSDs, ASDs, or ECDs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not show a protective effect of FA on heart anomalies 
      among infants with DS.

TI  - Location and number of sutures placed for hiatal hernia repair during 
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding: does it matter?
PG  - 58-64
LID - 10.1007/s00464-013-3161-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that hiatal hernia repair (HHR) during 
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) decreases the rate of reoperation. 
      However, the technical aspects (location and number of sutures) are not 
      standardized. It is unknown whether such technical details are associated with 
      differing rates of reoperation for band-related problems. METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis was performed from a single institution, including 2,301 
      patients undergoing LAGB with HHR from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. 
      Independent variables were number and location of sutures. Data collected 
      included demographics, operating room (OR) time, length of stay (LOS), follow-up 
      time, postoperative BMI/%EWL, and rates of readmission/reoperation. Statistical 
      analyses included ANOVA and Chi squared tests. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox 
      regression tests were used for follow-up data and reoperation rates, in order to 
      account for differential length of follow-up and confounding variables. RESULTS: 
      There was no difference in length of follow-up among all groups. The majority of 
      patients had one suture (range 1-6; 55 %). Patients with fewer sutures had 
      shorter OR time (1 suture 45 min vs. 4+ sutures 56 min, p < 0.0001). LOS, 30-day 
      readmission, band-related reoperation, and postop BMI/%EWL were not statistically 
      significant. Anterior suture placement (vs. posterior vs. both) was most common 
      (61 %). OR time was shorter in those with anterior suture (41 min vs. posterior 
      56 min vs. both 59 min, p < 0.0001). Patients with posterior suture had a longer 
      LOS (84 % 1 day vs. anterior 74 % 1 day vs. both 74 % 1 day, p < 0.0001). There 
      was no difference in 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and 
      postoperative BMI/%EWL. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have 
      shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and 
      postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The 
      technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or 
      reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.

TI  - Does the distribution of health care benefits in Kenya meet the principles of 
      universal coverage?
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-12-20 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 58th World Health Assembly called for all health systems to move 
      towards universal coverage where everyone has access to key promotive, 
      preventive, curative and rehabilitative health interventions at an affordable 
      cost. Universal coverage involves ensuring that health care benefits are 
      distributed on the basis of need for care and not on ability to pay. The 
      distribution of health care benefits is therefore an important policy question, 
      which health systems should address. The aim of this study is to assess the 
      distribution of health care benefits in the Kenyan health system, compare changes 
      over two time periods and demonstrate the extent to which the distribution meets 
      the principles of universal coverage. METHODS: Two nationally representative 
      cross-sectional households surveys conducted in 2003 and 2007 were the main 
      sources of data. A comprehensive analysis of the entire health system is 
      conducted including the public sector, private-not-for-profit and 
      private-for-profit sectors. Standard benefit incidence analysis techniques were 
      applied and adopted to allow application to private sector services. RESULTS: The 
      three sectors recorded similar levels of pro-rich distribution in 2003, but in 
      2007, the private-not-for-profit sector was pro-poor, public sector benefits 
      showed an equal distribution, while the private-for-profit sector remained 
      pro-rich. Larger pro-rich disparities were recorded for inpatient compared to 
      outpatient benefits at the hospital level, but primary health care services were 
      pro-poor. Benefits were distributed on the basis of ability to pay and not on 
      need for care. CONCLUSIONS: The principles of universal coverage require that all 
      should benefit from health care according to need. The Kenyan health sector is 
      clearly inequitable and benefits are not distributed on the basis of need. 
      Deliberate efforts should be directed to restructuring the Kenyan health system 
      to address access barriers and ensure that all Kenyans benefit from health care 
      when they need it.

TI  - Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health 
      data?
PG  - 63
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-13-63 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a 
      valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative 
      purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to 
      be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage 
      methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this 
      study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a 
      hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major 
      depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in 
      pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women 
      suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to 
      hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or 
      their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital 
      clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. 
      METHODS: Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western 
      Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women 
      with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the 
      Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 
      dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two 
      ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant 
      medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A 
      Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, 
      including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to 
      depression. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least 
      one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 
      (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery 
      admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 
      7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we 
      determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 
      pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women 
      dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on 
      their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the 
      prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. 
      CONCLUSION: No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile 
      for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed 
      antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.

AB  - PURPOSE: The proper angle of miniscrew insertion is important for cortical 
      anchorage, patient safety, and biomechanical control. The purposes of this study 
      are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the 
      posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew 
      insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or 
      types of malocclusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 100 
      individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. 
      Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The 
      predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The 
      demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle 
      Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and 
      inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the 
      cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45 degrees , 60 degrees , and 90 degrees  in 
      relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors 
      were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). 
      Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the 
      inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of 
      variance for repeated measures was used. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 100 
      patients with a mean age of 17.4 +/- 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male 
      patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular 
      space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 
      to 13.77 mm. The thickness tended to decrease with the increase in insertion 
      angle from 45 degrees  to 90 degrees . No significant differences between the genders or types of 
      malocclusion were found. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the 
      safest areas for the placement of miniscrews are between the first and second 
      premolars and between the first and second molars, regardless of the angle of 
      insertion.

TI  - SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is 
      there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?
PG  - 337-44
LID - 10.1007/s12149-012-0577-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical 
      grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients 
      presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical 
      pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, 
      N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called 
      FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to 
      be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm 
      dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is 
      to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them 
      from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data 
      in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones 
      of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD 
      diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs. 
      METHODS: Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 
      28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 
      patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with 
      unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were 
      included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and 
      measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the 
      caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals. RESULTS: Qualitative 
      (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the 
      uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and 
      ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in 
      the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant 
      differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. 
      There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left 
      putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients 
      with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right 
      putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET 
      at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical 
      presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of 
      them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an 
      equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and 
      Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of 
      striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the 
      nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of 
      essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to 
      understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration.

TI  - Are many colorectal cancers due to missed adenomas?
PG  - 20-3
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2008.03.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An unknown number of colorectal cancers could be due to missed 
      adenomas during previous endoscopy. Data in the literature are sparse. A large 
      cross-sectional study was done in a prospective database of all patients 
      diagnosed with colorectal cancer. METHODS: All consecutive endoscopies over a 
      period of 15 years, in which colorectal cancer was diagnosed were included. All 
      patients who underwent more than one endoscopy and in whom ultimately cancer was 
      diagnosed were studied separately. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 
      835 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent a previous endoscopy without a 
      cancer diagnosis. These 25 patients were divided into three groups according to 
      the time between the endoscopy in which the cancer was detected and the previous 
      endoscopy. Five out of these 25 patients underwent regular surveillance. Only 11 
      patients had no argument for regular follow-up. Assuming that these cancers 
      developed from an adenoma than only 11 out of 835 (1.3%) cancers were missed in 
      the adenoma phase. There was no difference in the size of the tumour between the 
      three groups of patients. CONCLUSION: In normal daily practice, only a small 
      number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed 
      adenomas probably is being exaggerated.

TI  - Clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle 
      cell disease: is it accurate enough?
PG  - 64-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of empiric chest radiography (CXR) 
      is of significant value in detecting clinically unsuspected acute chest syndrome 
      (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Patients with 
      SCD presenting to the emergency department and hematology clinic with temperature 
      greater than or equal to 38 degrees C were prospectively evaluated using a 
      physician-completed questionnaire. The questionnaire included inquiries into the 
      patient's physical signs and symptoms and the physician's clinical impression for 
      the presence of ACS. The questionnaire was completed before obtaining CXR results 
      in all patients. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with SCD with 96 febrile events 
      were evaluated over a 1-year period. Twenty-four percent (23/96) of the patients 
      had CXR evidence of ACS. On the basis of the questionnaire data, 61% (14/23) of 
      ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the evaluating physician before 
      obtaining CXR. Comparing the patients with and without ACS revealed that, with 
      the exception of splinting (4/23 [17%] versus 0/73 [0%]), no symptom or physical 
      examination finding helped to identify which patients had ACS. Fifty-seven 
      percent of patients with ACS had completely normal findings on physical 
      examination. The presentation of patients with clinically detected versus 
      clinically unsuspected ACS also did not differ significantly. Length of 
      hospitalization, oxygen use, and need for transfusion were the same in both the 
      unsuspected and detected ACS groups. Overall physician sensitivity for predicting 
      ACS was only 39%, and diagnostic accuracy did not improve significantly with 
      increasing levels of pediatric training. CONCLUSION: ACS is common in patients 
      with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating 
      physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in 
      defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and 
      morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a 
      febrile patient with SCD.

TI  - Can nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without 
      atypia be distinguished by fine-needle aspiration cytology?
PG  - 22-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytologic criteria reported to be helpful in the distinction of 
      proliferative breast disease without atypia (PBD) from nonproliferative breast 
      disease (NPBD) have not been rigorously tested. METHODS: Fifty-one air-dried, 
      Diff-Quik-stained fine-needle aspirates (FNA) of palpable breast lesions with 
      biopsy-proven diagnoses of NPBD (34 cases) or PBD (17 cases) were reviewed. The 
      smears were evaluated for the cellularity, size, and architectural arrangement of 
      the epithelial groups; the presence of single epithelial cells and myoepithelial 
      cells; and nuclear characteristics. RESULTS: The only cytologic feature found to 
      be significantly different between PBD and NPBD was a swirling pattern of 
      epithelial cells. A swirling pattern was noted in 13 of 17 PBD cases (76%) and 12 
      of 34 NPBD cases (35%) (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Because there is significant 
      overlap in cytologic features between NPBD and PBD, the distinction between the 
      two entities is difficult in cytologic sampling.

TI  - Is vancomycin MIC creep a worldwide phenomenon? Assessment of S. aureus 
      vancomycin MIC in a tertiary university hospital.
PG  - 65
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-6-65 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by 
      methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin 
      treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration 
      (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have 
      identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over 
      recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this 
      is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers. METHODS: The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of 
      MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA 
      isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 
      were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. 
      Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis. RESULTS: A total 
      of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 
      mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. 
      During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of 
      MRSA with a vancomycin MIC > 1 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, 
      p = 0.002). No MRSA isolate presented a MIC > 2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable 
      to find in our institution data compatible to the presence of vancomycin MIC 
      creep during the study period. This phenomenon seems not to be generalized; as a 
      result each institution should systematically monitor MRSA vancomycin MIC over 
      time.

TI  - Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease?
PG  - 607-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy characterized by 
      villus atrophy and malabsorption of essential nutrients. Vitamin D deficiency has 
      been described in autoimmune diseases, but its status in prepubertal children 
      with CD has not been adequately studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the vitamin D 
      status of prepubertal children with CD. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 
      prepubertal children aged 3-12 years with CD (n=24) who were compared to 
      prepubertal, non-CD children of the same age (n=50). Children were included in 
      the study if they had a diagnosis of CD by intestinal biopsy, and were not on a 
      gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients were excluded if they had diseases of calcium or 
      vitamin D metabolism, or were receiving calcium or vitamin D supplementation or 
      had other autoimmune diseases. All subjects had their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
      [25(OH)D] level measured. RESULTS: There was no difference in 25(OH)D level 
      between the CD and non-CD children (27.58 +/- 9.91 versus 26.20 +/- 10.45, p = 
      0.59). However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese 
      groups, the non-obese CD patients had a significantly higher 25(OH)D level than 
      the obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 21.58 +/- 5.67, p = 0.009). In 
      contrast, there was no difference in 25(OH)D level between non-obese CD patients 
      and non-obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 30.64 +/-12.08, p = 0.52). 
      The season of 25(OH)D measurement was not a significant confounder (p =0.7). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal 
      children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.

TI  - Is renal warm ischemia over 30 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy 
      possible? One-year results of a prospective study.
PG  - 1170-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate renal damage and impairment of renal function 1 yr after 
      laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) with warm ischemia >30 min. METHODS: From 
      July 2004 to June 2005, 18 patients underwent LPN with warm ischemia time >30 
      min. Kidney damage markers (daily proteinuria and tubular enzymes) and renal 
      function (serum creatinine, cystatin C, and creatinine clearances) were assessed 
      on postoperative days 1 and 5 and at 12 mo. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 
      evaluated before surgery and at 3 mo. Renal scintigraphy was performed before the 
      procedure, at 5 d and at 3 and 12 mo postoperatively. Statistical analysis was 
      performed using the Student t test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In 
      terms of kidney damage and renal function markers, the statistical analysis 
      demonstrated that at 1 yr there was complete return to the normal range and no 
      statistical difference between the values at the various time points. The GFR was 
      not significantly different before and 3 mo after surgery. In terms of 
      scintigraphy of the operated kidney, the values were 48.35+/-3.82% (40-50%) 
      before the procedure, 36.88+/-8.42 (16-50%) on postoperative day 5 (p=0.0001), 
      40.56+/-8.96 (20-50%) at 3 mo (p=0.003), and 42.8+/-7.2% (20-50%) 1 yr after 
      surgery (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that kidney damage occurs 
      during LPN when warm ischemia is >30 min. This damage is only partially 
      reversible and efforts should be made to keep warm ischemia within 30 min.

TI  - PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy?
PG  - 203-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can show wide fluctuations 
      when repeatedly measured. Here we investigatewd if: (a) biopsy timing influences 
      the prostate cancer (PC) detection rate in patients with fluctuating PSA 
      (flu-PSA) in comparison with patients with steadily increasing PSA (si-PSA); (b) 
      PSA slope estimated in patients with flu-PSA predicts a different risk of cancer 
      detection; (c) flu-PSA and si-PSA patients develop PC in topographically 
      different sites; (d) the behaviour of pre-operative PSA is an expression of a 
      disease with defferent characteristics to the following radical prostatectomy. 
      METHODS: The study involved 211 patients who underwent at least a second biopsy 
      after a first negative prostate biopsy. PSA Slope, PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSA 
      doubling time (PSADT) were estimated. Flu-PSA level was defined as a PSA series 
      with at least one PSA value lower than the one immediately preceding it. RESULTS: 
      82 patients had flu-PSA levels and 129 si-PSA levels. There were no significant 
      differences between the two groups in terms of cancer detection, clinical or 
      pathological stage, but the si-PSA group with cancer had a higher Gleason score. 
      No difference was found for PSA Slope between flu-PSA patients with cancer and 
      those without. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates no difference in PC detection 
      rate at repeat biopsy between patients with flu or si-PSA levels. PSA Slope, PSAV 
      and PSADT were not found helpful tools in cancer detection.

LID - S0960-9776(12)00209-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.breast.2012.10.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) provides psychological benefit 
      to many early breast cancer patients however concerns persist regarding its 
      potential impact on chemotherapy delivery. We investigated the association 
      between IBR, complications and adjuvant chemotherapy delivery. METHOD: 
      Retrospective analysis of patients in an academic breast service, who underwent 
      mastectomy, with or without reconstruction, and received adjuvant chemotherapy. 
      RESULTS: Comparisons were made between 107 patients who received IBR and 113 who 
      received mastectomy alone. Those receiving IBR were on average younger, with 
      lower body mass index (BMI) and better prognoses. Overall complication rates were 
      comparable (mastectomy alone: 45.1% versus IBR: 35.5%, p = 0.2). There was more 
      return to surgery in the IBR group with 11.5% of tissue expanders requiring 
      removal, whilst more seromas occurred in the mastectomy group. There was no 
      significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: We found 
      no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although 
      there was a significant incidence of implant infection.

TI  - Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well 
      differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer?
PG  - 923-30
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not well 
      differentiated (w-d) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is indeed clinically early 
      cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy six patients with solitary small HCCs up 
      to 3 cm in diameter, who underwent hepatectomy, were observed for at least 2 
      years for possible recurrence. These patients were divided into two groups: 10 
      patients with w-d HCCs (Edmondson and Steiner's grade I) and 66 patients with 
      less differentiated (l-d) HCCs (Edmondson and Steiner's grade I-II, II-III, and 
      III). RESULTS: The histological analysis revealed that w-d HCCs had lower 
      incidences of fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01), when compared to l-d HCCs. 
      There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic 
      metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium 
      sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was 
      made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to 
      be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of 
      the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the 
      disease free survival between the two groups. An analysis of tumor volume 
      doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci had been 
      present at the time of operation. CONCLUSIONS: W-d HCCs were clinically 
      demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference 
      in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.

TI  - Does a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improve bariatric 
      surgery outcomes? A pilot randomized study.
PG  - 853-61
LID - 10.1007/s00464-011-1966-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many insurance payors mandate that bariatric surgery candidates 
      undergo a medically supervised weight management (MSWM) program as a prerequisite 
      for surgery. However, there is little evidence to support this requirement. We 
      evaluated in a randomized controlled trial the hypothesis that participation in a 
      MSWM program does not predict outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric 
      banding (LAGB) in a publicly insured population. METHODS: This pilot randomized 
      trial was conducted in a large academic urban public hospital. Patients who met 
      NIH consensus criteria for bariatric surgery and whose insurance did not require 
      a mandatory 6-month MSWM program were randomized to a MSWM program with monthly 
      visits over 6 months (individual or group) or usual care for 6 months and then 
      followed for bariatric surgery outcomes postoperatively. Demographics, weight, 
      and patient behavior scores, including patient adherence, eating behavior, 
      patient activation, and physical activity, were collected at baseline and at 6 
      months (immediately preoperatively and postoperatively). RESULTS: A total of 55 
      patients were enrolled in the study with complete follow-up on 23 patients. 
      Participants randomized to a MSWM program attended an average of 2 sessions 
      preoperatively. The majority of participants were female and non-Caucasian, mean 
      age was 46 years, average income was less than $20,000/year, and most had 
      Medicaid as their primary insurer, consistent with the demographics of the 
      hospital's bariatric surgery program. Data analysis included both 
      intention-to-treat and completers' analyses. No significant differences in weight 
      loss and most patient behaviors were found between the two groups 
      postoperatively, suggesting that participation in a MSWM program did not improve 
      weight loss outcomes for LAGB. Participation in a MSWM program did appear to have 
      a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively. CONCLUSION: MSWM does not 
      appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative 
      bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes 
      after LAGB in our patient population.

TI  - Bony defects in chronic anterior posttraumatic dislocation of the shoulder: Is 
      there a correlation between humeral and glenoidal lesions?
PG  - 581-6
LID - 10.1007/s00590-016-1815-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of combined humeral and glenoid defects varies between 
      79 and 84 % in case of chronic posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability. The 
      main goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between humeral and 
      glenoid defects based on quantitative radiological criteria. METHODS: A 
      retrospective study was performed between 2000 and 2011 including patients who 
      underwent primary surgical shoulder stabilization for chronic posttraumatic 
      anterior shoulder instability, with bone defects in both the glenoid and humerus 
      and a healthy contralateral shoulder. The following measurements were taken: D/R 
      ratio (Hill-Sachs lesion depth/humeral head radius) on an AP X-ray in internal 
      rotation and the D1/D2 ratio [diameter of the involved glenoid articular surfaces 
      (D1)/the healthy one (D2)] on a comparative Bernageau glenoid profile view. 
      Measurements were taken by two observers. Correlations were determined by the 
      Spearman correlation coefficients (r), Bland and Altman diagrams, and intra-class 
      correlation coefficients (ICC). A sample size calculation was done. RESULTS: 
      Thirty patients were included, 25 men/5 women, mean age 29.8 +/- 11.2 years. The 
      mean D/R was 23 +/- 12 % for observer 1 and 23 +/- 10 % for observer 2. The mean 
      D1/D2 was 95 +/- 4 % for observer 1 and 94 +/- 6 % for observer 2. No significant 
      correlation was found between humeral and glenoid bone defects by observer 1 
      (r = 0.23, p = 0.22) or observer 2 (r = 0.05, p = 0.78). Agreement of the 
      observers for the D/R ratio was excellent (ICC = 0.89 +/- 0.04, p < 0.00001) and 
      good for the D1/D2 ratio (ICC = 0.54 +/- 0.14, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Humeral and 
      glenoid bone defects were not correlated. Inter-observer reliability was 
      excellent for the D/R ratio and good for the D1/D2 ratio. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Nonconsecutive Patients, Diagnostic Study, Level III.

TI  - Does the bracket-ligature combination affect the amount of orthodontic space 
      closure over three months? A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 155-62
LID - 10.1179/1465313313Y.0000000044 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of bracket-ligature combination on the 
      amount of orthodontic space closure over three months. DESIGN: Randomized 
      clinical trial with three parallel groups. SETTING: A hospital orthodontic 
      department (Chesterfield Royal Hospital, UK). PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients 
      requiring upper first premolar extractions. METHODS: Informed consent was 
      obtained and participants were randomly allocated into one of three groups: (1) 
      conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and elastomeric ligatures; (2) 
      conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and Super Slick((R)) low friction 
      elastomeric ligatures; (3) Damon 3MX((R)) passive self-ligating brackets. Space 
      closure was undertaken on 0.019x0.025-inch stainless steel archwires with 
      nickel-titanium coil springs. Participants were recalled at four weekly 
      intervals. Upper alginate impressions were taken at each visit (maximum three). 
      The primary outcome measure was the mean amount of space closure in a 3-month 
      period. RESULTS: A one-way ANOVA was undertaken [dependent variable: mean space 
      closure (mm); independent variable: group allocation]. The amount of space 
      closure was very similar between the three groups (1 mm per 28 days); however, 
      there was a wide variation in the rate of space closure between individuals. The 
      differences in the amount of space closure over three months between the three 
      groups was very small and non-significant (P = 0.718). CONCLUSION: The hypothesis 
      that reducing friction by modifying the bracket/ligature interface increases the 
      rate of space closure was not supported. The major determinant of orthodontic 
      tooth movement is probably the individual patient response.

TI  - Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices? 
      Solving mysteries related to the cigarette pricing mechanism in China.
PG  - 560-2
LID - 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050027 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explain China's cigarette pricing mechanism and the role of the 
      Chinese State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) on cigarette pricing and 
      taxation. METHODS: Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics 
      published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among 
      industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. RESULTS: The 
      2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher 
      retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that 
      retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being 
      collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise 
      tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and 
      lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of 
      cigarettes for consumers. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous studies have found that taxation 
      is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, 
      these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces 
      determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in 
      retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, 
      non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine 
      cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed 
      on to the retail price.

TI  - Attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations: is there a 
      consensus among breast surgeons?
PG  - 608-13
LID - 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2009.07.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this survey was to ascertain the most common surgical 
      practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in patients 
      desiring breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer to see if a consensus 
      exists for optimal treatment of patients. STUDY DESIGN: We sent a survey to 1,000 
      surgeons interested in the treatment of breast cancer. Three hundred eighty-one 
      surgeons responded to this survey and 351 were used for the analysis (response 
      rate of 38%). RESULTS: Answers showed a large variety in clinical practices among 
      breast surgeons across the country. There was little intraoperative margin 
      analysis; only 48% of surgeons examine the margins grossly with a pathologist and 
      even fewer used frozen sections or imprint cytology. Decisions to reexcise 
      specific margins varied greatly. For example, 57% of surgeons would never 
      reexcise for a positive deep margin, but 53% would always reexcise for a positive 
      anterior margin. Most importantly, there was a large range in answers about 
      acceptable margins with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Fifteen 
      percent of surgeons would accept any negative margin, 28% would accept a 1-mm 
      negative margin, 50% would accept a 2-mm negative margin, 12% would accept a 5-mm 
      negative margin, and 3% would accept a 10-mm negative margin. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US 
      for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue 
      remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, 
      additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to 
      examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with 
      chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in 
      breast-conservation treatment.

TI  - Does the sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm 
      surgery influence distal embolisation?
PG  - 61-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Embolisation of atherosclerotic debris during abdominal aortic 
      aneurysm (AAA) repair is responsible for significant peri-operative morbidity. 
      Reports have suggested that preferential clamping of the distal vessel(s) before 
      the proximal aorta may decrease the number of emboli passing distally and hence 
      reduce complications. METHODS: Forty patients undergoing AAA repair were 
      randomised to have either first clamping of the proximal aorta or the iliac 
      vessels. Emboli passing through the Superficial Femoral Arteries were detected 
      with a Transcranial Doppler ultrasound system. RESULTS: There was no difference 
      between the two groups in the number of emboli detected (p=0.49) and no 
      significant correlation between number of emboli and dissection time (r=0.0008). 
      However, there was a significantly higher number of emboli in the patient 
      sub-group that were current smokers (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be 
      no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is 
      applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.

PG  - 745-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether decreasing lengths of stay over time for selected 
      diagnostic categories were associated with increased hospital readmission rates 
      and mean number of physician visits after discharge. DESIGN: Retrospective 
      descriptive study. SETTING: The seven large (125 beds or more) acute care 
      hospitals in Winnipeg. PATIENTS: Manitoba residents admitted to any one of the 
      seven hospitals because acute myocardial infarction (AMI), bronchitis or asthma, 
      transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) and uterine or adnexal procedures for 
      nonmalignant disease during the fiscal years 1989-90 to 1992-93. Patients from 
      out of province, those who died in hospital, those with excessively long stays 
      (more than 60 days) and those who were transferred to or from another institution 
      were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of hospital stay, and rate of readmission 
      within 30 days after discharge for all four categories and mean number of 
      physician visits within 30 days after discharge for two categories (AMI and 
      bronchitis or asthma. RESULTS: The length of stay decreased significantly over 
      the 4 years for all of the four categories, the smallest change being observed 
      for patients with AMI (11.1%) and the largest for those with bronchitis or asthma 
      (22.0%). The readmission rates for AMI, bronchitis or asthma, and TURP showed no 
      consistent change over the 4 years. The readmission rate for uterine or adnexal 
      procedures increased significantly between the first and second year (chi 2 = 
      4.28, p = 0.04) but then remained constant over the next 3 years. The mean number 
      of physician visits increased slightly for AMI in the first year (1.92 to 2.01) 
      and then remained virtually the same. It decreased slightly for bronchitis or 
      asthma over the 4 years. There was no significant correlation between length of 
      stay and readmission rates for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in any of the four 
      categories. Also, no correlation was observed between length of stay and mean 
      number of physician visits for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in the categories 
      AMI and bronchitis or asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Improving hospital efficiency by 
      shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of 
      readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from 
      hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected 
      readmission rates.

TI  - Surgical management of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta: is endoaortic balloon 
      occlusion safe?
PG  - 1709-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Occlusion of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta by an endoaortic 
      inflatable balloon has been proposed as an alternative to conventional 
      cross-clamping to prevent injury to the vessel and distal embolization of debris. 
      The safety and the effectiveness of endoaortic occlusion have not been documented 
      in this setting. METHODS: Endoaortic occlusion was employed in 52 of 2,172 
      consecutive patients. Surgeon's choice was based on preoperative identification 
      of aortic calcifications or intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning. 
      Deaths and strokes were analyzed casewise and in aggregate. RESULTS: In 10 
      patients (19.2%), the endoaortic balloon had to be replaced by the ordinary 
      cross-clamp because of incomplete occlusion (n = 5), hindered exposure (n = 2), 
      or balloon rupture (n = 3). In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (25%), and 
      stroke on awakening from anesthesia in 2 (3.8%). The death rate of patients 
      treated by endoaortic occlusion was significantly higher compared with all other 
      patients (4.2%, p < 0.0001) and with the expected estimate by European System for 
      Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (10.5%, p = 0.05). By multivariable analysis, 
      use of endoaortic occlusion was independently associated with in-hospital death 
      (odds ratio = 5.609, 95% confidence interval: 2.684 to 11.719). Although the 
      stroke rate was higher in the endoaortic occlusion group compared with all other 
      patients, the difference was only possibly significant (3.8% versus 0.8%, p = 
      0.067). CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the endoaortic occlusion was frequently 
      ineffective, and was associated with a significantly higher risk of in-hospital 
      death and a numerically higher risk of stroke.

TI  - Is there a relationship between serum paraoxonase level and epicardial fat tissue 
      thickness?
PG  - 115-20
LID - 10.5152/akd.2014.4742 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to show the relationship between serum paraoxonase 1 
      level and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. METHODS: Two hundred and seven 
      patients without any atherosclerotic disease history were included in this 
      cross-sectional observational study. Correlation analysis was performed to 
      determine the correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness, which was 
      measured by echocardiography and serum paraoxonase 1 level. Also correlation 
      analysis was performed to show correlation between patients' clinical and 
      laboratory findings and the level of serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) and the 
      epicardial fat tissue thickness. Pearson and Spearman test were used for 
      correlation analysis. RESULTS: No linear correlation between epicardial fat 
      tissue thickness and serum PON 1 found (correlation coefficient: -0.127, 
      p=0.069). When epicardial fat tissue thickness were grouped as 7 mm and over, and 
      below, and 5 mm and over, and below, serum PON 1 level were significantly lower 
      in >/=7 mm group (PON1 : 168.9 U/L) than <7 mm group (PON 1: 253.9 U/L) (p<0.001). 
      Also hypertension prevalence was increased in >/=7 mm group (p=0.001). Serum 
      triglyceride was found to be higher in >/=7 mm group (p=0.014), body mass index was 
      found higher in >/=5 mm group (p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Serum PON 1 level is not 
      correlated with the epicardial fat tissue thickness. But PON 1 level is lower in 
      patients with epicardial fat tissue thickness 7 mm and over. Therefore, increased 
      atherosclerosis progression can be found among patients with 7 mm and higher 
      epicardial fat tissue thickness.

TI  - Do antibiotics decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity?
PG  - 705-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A tonsillectomy audit was carried out and compared with other studies, 
      to emphasize the role of antibiotics. METHODS: This study was carried out at 
      North West Armed Forces Hospital, Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the year 
      January 1999 through to December 1999. This is a retrospective study of patients 
      who had tonsillectomy with or with adenoidectomy, the topics audited included 
      indication for surgery, grade of surgeon, method of surgery, length of hospital 
      stay, complications and the use of postoperative antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 
      185 patients underwent tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. The patients 
      age ranged between 2 years to 53 years and the majority were children. In our 
      audit we found no difference with regard to grade of surgeons, method of 
      hemostasis in the outcome of surgery. Moreover, postoperative antibiotics had no 
      role in pain control, postoperative fever, secondary hemorrhage or reduction in 
      hospital stay. The administration of analgesics on the basis of, as required, had 
      poor pain control. CONCLUSION: Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to 
      have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on 
      the basis of as required had a limited value.

TI  - Should prostate specific antigen be adjusted for body mass index? Data from the 
      Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.
PG  - 2646-51
LID - 10.1016/j.juro.2009.08.041 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Obesity may be associated with lower prostate specific antigen through 
      hemodilution. We examined the relationship between body mass index and prostate 
      specific antigen by age in men without prostate cancer in a longitudinal aging 
      study to determine whether prostate specific antigen must be adjusted for body 
      mass index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included 994 men (4,937 
      observations) without prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of 
      Aging. Mixed effects models were used to examine the relationship between 
      prostate specific antigen and body mass index in kg/m(2) by age. Separate models 
      were explored in men with prostate cancer censored at diagnosis, for percent body 
      fat measurements, for weight changes with time and adjusting for initial prostate 
      size in 483 men (2,523 observations) with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging 
      measurements. RESULTS: In men without prostate cancer body mass index was not 
      significantly associated with prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age 
      (p = 0.06). A 10-point body mass index increase was associated with a prostate 
      specific antigen difference of -0.03 ng/ml (95% CI -0.40-0.49). Results were 
      similar when men with prostate cancer were included, when percent body fat was 
      substituted for body mass index, and after adjusting for prostate volume. 
      Longitudinal weight changes also had no significant association with prostate 
      specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse 
      relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the 
      magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen 
      for body mass index does not appear warranted.

TI  - Is it necessary to insert a nasobiliary drainage tube routinely after endoscopic 
      clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced 
      cholangitis? A prospective, randomized trial.
PG  - 105-10
LID - 10.1016/j.gie.2009.08.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about whether a routinely inserted endoscopic 
      nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube improves the clinical course in patients with 
      choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis after clearance of 
      choledocholithiasis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the need 
      for ENBD on the clinical outcomes of patients with acute cholangitis undergoing 
      endoscopic clearance of common bile duct (CBD) stones. DESIGN: Prospective, 
      randomized study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 104 
      patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent primary 
      endoscopic treatment were compared according to insertion of an ENBD tube (51 in 
      the ENBD group and 53 in the no-ENBD group). INTERVENTION: Insertion of an ENBD 
      tube after clearance of CBD stones. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Recurrence of 
      cholangitis and length of hospital stay after clearance of CBD stones. RESULTS: 
      Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between both groups. There were no 
      significant differences in the recurrence rate of cholangitis at 24 weeks (3.9% 
      for the ENBD group vs 3.8% for the no-ENBD group at 24 weeks; P = .99) and length 
      of hospital stay (7.9 days [standard error = 1.2] for the ENBD group vs 7.9 days 
      [standard error = 0.7] for the no-ENBD group; P = .98). However, procedure time 
      was longer (26.2 [SE = 1.8] minutes vs 22.7 [SE = 1.0] minutes, respectively; P = 
      .01) and the discomfort score was higher (4.9 [SE = 0.4] vs 2.8 [SE = 0.3], 
      respectively; P = .02) in the ENBD group than in the no-ENBD group. LIMITATIONS: 
      Single-center study. CONCLUSIONS: A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve 
      the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time 
      and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.

TI  - Have antiepileptic drug prescription claims changed following the FDA suicidality 
      warning? An evaluation in a state Medicaid program.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communicated 
      concerns and, in May 2009, issued a warning about an increased risk of 
      suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This research evaluated the 
      association between the FDA suicidality communications and the AED prescription 
      claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder. METHODS: A 
      longitudinal interrupted time-series design was utilized to evaluate Oklahoma 
      Medicaid claims data from January 2006 through December 2009. The study included 
      9289 continuously eligible members with prevalent diagnoses of epilepsy and/or 
      psychiatric disorder and at least one AED prescription claim. Trends, expressed 
      as monthly changes in the log odds of AED prescription claims, were compared 
      across three time periods: before (January 2006 to January 2008), during 
      (February 2008 to May 2009), and after (June 2009 to December 2009) the FDA 
      warning. RESULTS: Before the FDA warning period, a significant upward trend of 
      AED prescription claims of 0.01% per month (99% CI: 0.008% to 0.013%, p<0.0001) 
      was estimated. In comparison to the prewarning period, no significant change in 
      trend was detected during (-20.0%, 99% CI: -70.0% to 30.0%, p=0.34) or after 
      (80.0%, 99% CI: -20.0% to 200.0%, p=0.03) the FDA warning period. After 
      stratification, no diagnostic group (i.e., epilepsy alone, epilepsy and comorbid 
      psychiatric disorder, and psychiatric disorder alone) experienced a significant 
      change in trend during the entire study period (p>0.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the 
      time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear 
      to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the 
      study population.

TI  - Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants?
PG  - F291-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be 
      a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway 
      pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae 
      (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm 
      infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC. 
      OBJECTIVE: To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm 
      infants. METHODS: An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or 
      BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using 
      a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was 
      measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA). 
      RESULTS: A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 
      infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with 
      set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in 
      average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 
      to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean 
      (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing 
      BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend 
      to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows. CONCLUSIONS: At the gas flows 
      studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.

TI  - Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to 
      hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar 
      disorder phenotype?
PG  - 610-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine family-based transmission of the number of 5' flanking 
      arginine vasopressin V1a receptor (AVPR1A) microsatellites, which include 
      [(GATA)(14)] and complex [(CT)(4)-TT-(CT)(8)-(GT)(24)] repeats, in probands with 
      a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype (PEA-BP). 
      Preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to 
      hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands was hypothesized, based on 
      reports from preclinical work in the literature. METHODS: Probands were 83 
      participants in an ongoing controlled study of PEA-BP. The PEA-BP phenotype was 
      defined by DSM-IV mania with at least one of the cardinal symptoms of mania 
      (elation and/or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that 
      overlapped with those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
      Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University 
      in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia 
      (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about 
      themselves. Hypersexuality and uninhibited people-seeking were assessed from the 
      corresponding WASH-U-KSADS items. Microsatellite genotyping of the AVPR1A repeats 
      was conducted using fluorescently labeled primers and detected by laser-induced 
      fluorescence. Alleles were determined with the assistance of semi-automated 
      allele-calling software. There were 32 complete, biological trios (28 informative 
      families) for the GATA repeat and 34 complete, biological trios (30 informative 
      families) for the complex repeat. Data were analyzed using case-control and 
      family-based association methods. RESULTS: Preferential transmission of AVPR1A 
      GATA or complex repeats was not significant for hypersexuality or uninhibited 
      people-seeking, using the transmission disequilibrium test. Similarly, 
      case-control analyses found no significant associations between hypersexuality or 
      uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats. For 
      p < 0.05, there was about 80% power to detect odds ratios of 5.0 and 4.0 (in the 
      family-based analyses) and 3.5 and 2.6 (in the case-control analyses), for allele 
      frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. CONCLUSION: Preferential transmission 
      of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not 
      supported.

TI  - Are variations in the use of carotid endarterectomy explained by population Need? 
      A study of health service utilisation in two English health regions.
PG  - 501-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to describe variation in utilisation of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) 
      within two English health regions and explore relationships between use, need and 
      proximity to services. DESIGN: consecutive case series of operations. Comparison 
      at a population level with district stroke mortality, hospital admissions and 
      material deprivation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: standardised utilisation rates for 
      CEA and measures of inter-district variability. Spearman's rank correlation 
      coefficients for associations between variables. RESULTS: variation in 
      utilisation rates was considerable (14-fold difference across district 
      populations). More individuals had bilateral surgery in the Yorkshire region than 
      in the Northern (11.7% vs. 5.5%, p=0.002). There was no association between 
      utilisation rates for CEA and district stroke mortality (r=-0.06, 95% CI -0.41 to 
      0.30) or admission rates for stroke (r=0.17, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.49). There was a 
      strong relationship between residence in districts where services were located 
      and higher utilisation. Rates of CEA were lowest in the regions' most affluent 
      wards. CONCLUSION: use of CEA varies widely, depending on area of residence. 
      Variation is not a consequence of differences in need, but reflects clinical 
      practice and supply of services. There is evidence to suggest unmet need for CEA.

TI  - Do supervised colorectal trainees differ from consultants in terms of quality of 
      TME surgery?
PG  - 790-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The quality of surgical excision is held to be a major determinant of 
      outcome following surgery for rectal cancer. Macroscopic examination of the 
      excised mesorectum allows for reproducible assessment of the quality of surgery. 
      We aimed to determine whether quality of excision undertaken by colorectal 
      trainees under supervision was comparable with that performed by consultants, as 
      measured using mesorectal grades. METHOD: A total of 130 consecutive patients 
      undergoing potentially curative resection for primary adenocarcinoma of the 
      rectum in our centre from 2001 to 2003 were included in the study. The 
      pathologists graded the excised mesorectum according to staged classification 
      proposed by Quirke. The outcome (quality of mesorectal excision and secondary 
      outcomes including local recurrence and overall recurrence) of operations 
      performed by consultants was compared with that of trainees. Statistical 
      significance was tested using Pearson chi(2) test. RESULTS: Eighty-nine 
      operations were performed by consultants and 41 by senior colorectal trainees 
      with consultant supervision. Forty-four patients (49%) had good mesorectum when 
      operated by consultants in comparison with 17 (41.5%) by the trainees. There was 
      no statistically significant difference (P = 0.717) between the two groups in 
      terms of quality of mesorectum excised after potentially curative resection. 
      Furthermore, there were seven local recurrences in patients operated by 
      consultants (7.8%) when compared with four in the trainee group (9.5%) and once 
      again there was no statistical significance between the two groups (P = 0.719). 
      CONCLUSION: We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by 
      mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with 
      that achieved by consultants.

LID - S0165-0327(16)30998-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2016.09.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), 
      particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer 
      subsequent MD outcomes. METHODS: Longitudinal data were used to model 
      associations between a four-level classification of MD/AUD during the period 
      15-18 years (neither; MD-only; AUD-only; comorbid MD/AUD) and MD over the period 
      18-35 years. These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of 
      factors measured in childhood. RESULTS: The three disorder groups had rates of 
      adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher 
      than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid 
      MD/AUD group had significantly (p <.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in 
      the AUD-only group, and marginally (p <.10) higher rates of adult MD than those 
      in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates 
      of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer 
      statistically significant. The factors that explained the associations were 
      gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. 
      LIMITATIONS: The data were obtained by self-report, and may have been subject to 
      biases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher 
      rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by 
      increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the 
      comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, 
      rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.

TI  - Perioperative care in an animal model for training in abdominal surgery: is it 
      necessary a preoperative fasting?
PG  - 541-8
LID - S0102-86502011000600022 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: Demonstrate that the rabbit may be used in the training of surgery, in 
      addition to present its perioperative care. METHODS: Thirty two animals, with age 
      and weight, respectively, from 3 to 5.5 months old and 3000 to 4200 grams, were 
      undergone different periods of pre-operative fasting, exclusive intramuscular 
      anesthesia (ketamine+xylazine), laparotomy with total gastrectomy and total 
      splenectomy. It was dosed the pre-operative (initial) and post-surgical (end) 
      serum blood glucose, in addition to quantify the gastric content after the 
      resection of the part. RESULTS: The anesthetical-surgical procedure presented a 
      mortality rate of 3.125% (1:32) and a morbidity rate of 6.25% (2:32). It was 
      evidenced an initial mean blood glucose = 199.4 mg/dl and the end = 326.1 mg/dl. 
      In spite of extended fasting (minimum of 2 hours for the absolute fasting and 
      maximum of 8.5 hours for liquids, and 20.5 hours for solids) all animals 
      presented at the end of the surgical procedure any gastric content and a blood 
      glucose increase. Those with fasting for liquids and solids when compared to the 
      quantity of solid gastric content, presented a moderate negative degree of 
      correlation. CONCLUSION: The rabbit is a good model to be used in training of 
      surgery, with a low morbi-mortality, able to be anesthetized intramuscularly, 
      with no need of pre-operative fasting and does not present hypoglycemia even with 
      the extended fasting period.

TI  - Metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary 
      site: Is there a need for neck dissection?
PG  - 585-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes and patterns of 
      failure in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical lymph nodes from an 
      unknown head and neck primary origin, who were treated curatively with 
      radiotherapy, with or without neck dissection. METHODS: The study included 61 
      patients referred to the McGill University Hospital Centers from 1987 to 2002. 
      The median age was 57 years, with male to female ratio of 4:1. Distribution of 
      patients by N status was as follows: N1, 16 patients (26%); N2a, 18 (30%); N2b, 
      13 (22%); N2c, 7 (11%); and N3, 7 (11%). Twenty patients underwent neck 
      dissection (11 radical, 9 functional) and 41 patients had biopsy (9 fine-needle 
      aspiration and 32 excisional biopsy). All patients received radiotherapy. The 
      median dose to the involved node(s) was 64 Gy, and 60 Gy to the rest of the neck. 
      Treatment of the neck was bilateral in 50 patients (82%) and ipsilateral in 11 
      (18%). The minimum duration of the follow-up was 12 months, with the median of 32 
      months. RESULTS: The 5- and 8-year overall survival for the whole population was 
      79% and 67%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in 
      the 8-year actuarial overall survival (64.8% and 67.6%, respectively, p = .64) 
      and local relapse-free survival (75% vs 74.5%, respectively, p = .57), among 
      patients who had biopsy versus those who had neck dissection. CONCLUSION: In our 
      experience, definitive radiotherapy to the neck and the potential mucosal sites, 
      whether preceded by neck dissection or not, is effective to achieve a good local 
      control rate in the unknown primary cancer of the head and neck. The indication 
      for neck dissection, in particular for early nodal stage, is controversial.

TI  - Does Viral Co-Infection Influence the Severity of Acute Respiratory Infection in 
      Children?
PG  - e0152481
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0152481 [doi]
LID - e0152481
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple viruses are often detected in children with respiratory 
      infection but the significance of co-infection in pathogenesis, severity and 
      outcome is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To correlate the presence of viral co-infection 
      with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections 
      (ARI). METHODS: We collected detailed clinical information on severity for 
      children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study 
      (GENDRES network) between 2011-2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. 
      Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: 204 
      children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The 
      number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. 
      However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 
      4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher 
      clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 
      7.484; P-value < 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value < 
      0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor 
      in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU 
      admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 
      0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen 
      necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the 
      UK cohort. CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized 
      children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical 
      impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the 
      severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a 
      protective role.

      syndrome?
PG  - 1541-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) 
      has an effect on perioperative and postoperative thyroid function. DESIGN: 
      Prospective study comparing thyroid function during and after hypothermic and 
      normothermic CPB. SETTING: Cardiac surgical unit at a university-affiliated 
      hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve patients scheduled to undergo cardiac operations with 
      normothermic (n = 6) or hypothermic (n = 6) CPB. INTERVENTIONS: Blood was 
      analyzed for serum concentration of total thyroxine (TT4), total triiodothyronine 
      (TT3), free T3 (fT3), reverse T3 (rT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
      preoperatively, 60 min after CPB was initiated, 30 min after discontinuing CPB, 
      and on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, and 5. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients 
      who underwent either cold (26 degrees +/- 5 degrees C) or warm (35 degrees +/- 1 
      degree C) CPB were comparable with regard to age, body weight, duration of CPB, 
      cross-clamp time, use of inotropes, total heparin dose, and length of hospital 
      stay. Incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
      and death were similar. In both groups, TT4 and TT3 were reduced below baseline 
      values beginning with CPB and persisting for up to 5 days after CPB (p < 0.05), 
      free T3 was reduced for up to 3 days after CPB (p < 0.05), mean serum rT3 was 
      elevated on POD 1 and POD 3 (p < 0.05), and TSH remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: 
      The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the 
      development of the "euthyroid sick syndrome" during and after CPB. Despite these 
      changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal 
      postoperative recovery.

TI  - Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition?
PG  - 179-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is an uncommon variant of 
      chronic cholecystitis, characterized by marked thickening of the gallbladder wall 
      and dense local adhesions. It often mimics a gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), and may 
      coexist with GBC, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, the premalignant 
      nature of this entity is not known. This study was undertaken to assess the p53, 
      PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic 
      inflammation. METHODS: Sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically 
      resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and 
      control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and 
      PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the 
      percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the 
      percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off 
      value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin 
      expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear 
      staining. RESULTS: p53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, 
      but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 
      expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001). PCNA expression was seen in 
      65% of GBC cases and 11% of XGC, but not in chronic cholecystitis and control 
      gallbladders. PCNA expression was higher in GBC than XGC (P=0.0001), but there 
      was no significant difference between the XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control 
      gallbladder groups. Beta-catenin expression was positive in the GBC, XGC, chronic 
      cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. But the expression pattern in XGC, 
      chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders was homogenously membranous, 
      whereas in GBC the membranous expression pattern was altered to cytoplasmic and 
      nuclear. CONCLUSION: The expression of p53, PCNA and beta-catenin in XGC was 
      significantly different from GBC and similar to chronic cholecystitis, thus 
      indicating the inflammatory nature of XGC and may not support a premalignant 
      nature of the lesion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle 
      turbinate in patients with nasal septal deviation, before and after septoplasty. 
      METHODS: The mucosal and bony structures of the middle turbinate and the angle of 
      the septum were measured using radiological analysis before septoplasty and at 
      least one year after septoplasty. All pre- and post-operative measurements of the 
      middle turbinate were compared using the paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank 
      sum test. RESULTS: The dimensions of bony and mucosal components of the middle 
      turbinate on concave and convex sides of the septum were not significantly 
      changed by septoplasty. There was a significant negative correlation after 
      septoplasty between the angle of the septum and the middle turbinate total area 
      on the deviated side (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: The present study findings suggest 
      that compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate is not affected by 
      septoplasty, even after one year.

TI  - Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice?
PG  - 307-13
LID - 10.1007/s00228-009-0755-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Stock et al. (Eur Respir J 25:47-53, 2005) recently estimated asthma 
      prevalence in Germany using claims data on prescriptions and hospital diagnoses 
      and found high prevalence peaks in infants. Our objective was to critically 
      assess and discuss various aspects of identifying children with asthma using 
      prescription data. METHODS: We replicated the selection procedure of Stock et al. 
      using data on 290,919 children aged 0-17 years insured in the Gmunder ErsatzKasse 
      (GEK) in 2005. Asthma prevalence was also estimated in a sample of 17,641 
      children aged 0-17 years participating in the German Health Interview and 
      Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) from 2003 to 2006. 
      RESULTS: In children aged 0-4 years insured in the GEK, prevalences were found to 
      range from 11.7 to 17.7% for boys and from 7.2 to 11.1% for girls when the 
      criteria of Stock et al. were applied. A steady decline in prevalences was 
      observed in older age groups. Asthma prevalence estimated in the KiGGS data 
      showed a quite different distribution. In the age group 0-4 years, prevalences 
      were found to range from 0 to 2.6% in boys and from 0 to 1.0% in girls; in 
      children >4 years, prevalences were found to increase with increasing age. 
      CONCLUSIONS: When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma 
      medications were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other 
      respiratory diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had 
      prescriptions. We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a 
      good proxy for the disease.

TI  - Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of 
      life of HIV/AIDS patients? A cost-utility study.
PG  - 157-65
LID - 10.1016/j.sapharm.2010.12.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form 
      has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among 
      human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients. OBJECTIVES: This is a 
      cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated 
      fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in 
      antiretroviral therapy. METHOD: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was 
      used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with >/=2 active antiretroviral medications. 
      Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity 
      scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were 
      included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. 
      Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual 
      estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte 
      Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. RESULTS: Nine FXD antiretroviral 
      formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was 
      included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with >/=2 
      antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) 
      were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the 
      FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were 
      observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD 
      patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD 
      over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. 
      The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted 
      life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC 
      (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. 
      CONCLUSION: Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within 
      the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. 
      Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.

TI  - Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical 
      stimulation during aortic surgery?
PG  - 737-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced 
      hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been 
      investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to 
      evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control 
      intraoperative hypertension. METHODS: In 50 patients, scheduled for vascular 
      surgery, anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 microg/kg, midazolam 0.3 
      mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was 
      maintained with increments of drugs with controlled ventilation (N2O/O2=60/40%) 
      until the start of surgery. A 5 Mhz transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe 
      was inserted after intubation. Pulmonary artery catheter and TEE measurements 
      were obtained after induction (to)(control value), at surgical incision (t1) if 
      it was associated with an increase in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) greater 
      than 140 mmHg (hypertension) and after control of hemodynamic parameters by 
      administration of desflurane (return of systolic arterial pressure to within 20% 
      of the control value) (t2) in a fresh gas flow of 31/ min. RESULTS: Sixteen 
      patients developed hypertension at surgical incision. SAP was controlled by 
      desflurane in all 16 patients. Afterload assessed by systemic vascular resistance 
      index (SVRI), end-systolic wall-stress (ESWS) and left-ventricular stroke work 
      index (LVSWI) increased with incision until the hypertension returned to 
      post-induction values with mean end-tidal concentration of 5.1+/-0.7% desflurane. 
      No change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke 
      volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area 
      change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when 
      desflurane was added to restore blood pressure. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular 
      surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without 
      fear of major cardiac depressant effect.

TI  - Is fluoroscopy essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones?
PG  - 70-2
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ureteroscopy 
      for lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Between June 2001 and January 2005, a total of 110 patients with a mean age of 
      33.5 years (range 12-65) suffering from of lower ureteral calculi (below the 
      upper margin of the sacroiliac joint) prospectively underwent ureteroscopic 
      removal. Retrograde pyelography was avoided, and no safety guidewire was placed. 
      Whenever required, the ureteric meatus was dilated with a ureteric balloon under 
      direct vision. Double-J stent placement was done with the aid of ureteroscopy. A 
      fluoroscope was kept standby. The patients had a postoperative X-ray of the 
      kidney-ureter-bladder region to document the stone clearance. RESULTS: The mean 
      stone size was 8.7 mm (range 6-15). Complete clearance without the use of 
      fluoroscopy was achieved in 99 patients (94.2%). Fluoroscopy was required in 6 
      patients (4%) for calcified stricture (n = 1), duplex system (n = 1), narrow and 
      tortuous meatus causing difficulty in passing the 5-Fr balloon dilator (n = 3), 
      and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone (n = 1). Of the 13 patients 
      who required balloon dilatation it was successfully achieved without fluoroscopy. 
      Double-J stenting was done due to mucosal ulceration (n = 3), polypoid reaction 
      (n = 2), and perforation (n = 1). All these patients had correct placement of the 
      stent, as confirmed by X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region postoperatively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as 
      reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without 
      the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.

TI  - Does the treatment of amblyopia normalise subfoveal choroidal thickness in 
      amblyopic children?
PG  - 184-188
LID - 10.1111/cxo.12483 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Recent studies have found a choroidal thickening in amblyopic eyes and 
      suggested that there might be a relationship between the choroid and amblyopia. 
      The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a six-month treatment of 
      amblyopia on choroidal thickness in anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic children. 
      METHODS: Thirty-two anisometropic hyperopic children with unilateral amblyopia 
      were included in this prospective study. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was 
      measured as the distance between the retinal pigment epithelium and the 
      chorioscleral edge, by using spectral domain enhanced depth imaging optical 
      coherence tomography. The treatment of amblyopia was performed based on the full 
      correction of the refractive error with eyeglasses, a refractive adaptation phase 
      and occlusion by patching the fellow eye. RESULTS: The mean visual acuity of the 
      amblyopic eyes significantly increased from 0.35 +/- 0.3 to 0.16 +/- 0.2 logMAR after 
      the treatment (p < 0.001). The mean initial choroidal thickness was significantly 
      higher in the amblyopic eyes than in the fellow eyes (p = 0.019). There were no 
      significant differences between the pre- and post-treatment mean choroidal 
      thickness in the amblyopic eyes (p = 0.428) and in the fellow eyes (p = 0.343). 
      The mean choroidal thickness was still higher in the amblyopic eyes than in the 
      fellow eyes after the treatment (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Although a six-month 
      treatment of amblyopia increased the visual acuity of the anisometropic hyperopic 
      amblyopic eyes, it could not significantly change choroidal thickness. Our 
      results were in accordance with the conventional explanation, which suggests 
      visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus abnormalities in the pathophysiology 
      of amblyopia.

TI  - Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?
PG  - 17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic 
      malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally 
      dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se 
      should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that 
      the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close 
      association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger 
      than the superficial ones. When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be 
      most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the associations between tumor size and depth and the 
      prognostic importance of grade, size and depth in a population-based series of 
      490 adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall with 
      complete, 4.5 years minimum, follow-up. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed no 
      major prognostic effect of tumor depth when grade and size were taken into 
      account. The mean size of small tumors was the same whether superficial or deep 
      but the mean size of large and deep-seated tumors were one third larger than that 
      of large but superficial tumors. Tumor depth influenced the prognosis in the 
      subset of high-grade and large tumors. In this subset deep-seated tumors had 
      poorer survival rate than superficial tumors, which could be explained by the 
      larger mean size of the deep-seated tumors. CONCLUSION: Most of the prognostic 
      value of tumor depth in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or trunk wall can 
      be explained by the association between tumor size and depth.

TI  - Does performance in selection processes predict performance as a dental student?
PG  - 27-34
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0579.2011.00706.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated associations between the performance of dental 
      students in each of the three components of the selection procedure [academic 
      average, Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT) and 
      structured interview], socio-demographic characteristics and their academic 
      success in an undergraduate dental surgery programme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Longitudinal review of admissions data relating to students entering dental 
      education at the University of Otago, New Zealand, between 2004 and 2009 was 
      compared with academic performance throughout the dental programme. RESULTS AND 
      DISCUSSION: After controlling for variables, pre-admission academic average, UMAT 
      scores and interview performance did not predict performance as a dental student. 
      Class place in second year, however, was a strong predictor of class place in 
      final year. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the best predictors of higher 
      class placement in the final year were New Zealand European ethnicity and 
      domestic (rather than international) student status. Other socio-demographic 
      characteristics were not associated with performance. These interim findings 
      provide a sound base for the ongoing study. CONCLUSION: The study found important 
      socio-demographic differences in pre-admission test scores, but those scores did 
      not predict performance in the dental programme, whether measured in second year 
      or in final year.

TI  - Antiretroviral therapy related adverse effects: Can sub-Saharan Africa cope with 
      the new "test and treat" policy of the World Health Organization?
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s40249-017-0240-3 [doi]
LID - 24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
      initiation results in significant HIV transmission reduction. This is the 
      rationale behind the "test and treat" policy of the World Health Organization 
      (WHO). Implementation of this policy will lead to an increased incidence of 
      ART-related adverse effects, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Is the 
      region yet ready to cope with such a challenging issue? MAIN BODY: The 
      introduction and widespread use of ART have drastically changed the natural 
      history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related 
      adverse effects mainly explained by mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation 
      will get worse in the near future. Indeed, ART is associated with an increased 
      risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes and overt 
      diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. The prevalence 
      of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated 
      by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. Most SSA countries are 
      characterized by (extreme) poverty, very weak health systems, inadequate and low 
      quality of health services, inaccessibility to existing health facilities, lack 
      of (qualified) health personnel, lack of adequate equipment, inaccessibility and 
      unaffordability of medicines, and heavy workload in a context of a double burden 
      of disease. Additionally, there is dearth of data on the incidence and predictive 
      factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, to anticipate on strategies that 
      should be put in place to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or properly 
      estimate the upcoming burden and prepare an adequate response plan. These are 
      required if we are to anticipate and effectively prevent this upcoming burden. 
      CONCLUSION: While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits 
      of implementing the "test and treat" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet 
      prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and 
      metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if 
      SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the "test and treat" 
      policy.

TI  - Expression of c-kit protooncogen in hepatitis B virus-induced chronic hepatitis, 
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma: has it a diagnostic role?
PG  - 1206-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2007.01675.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: There are more than 350 million people worldwide chronically infected with 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV), who are at high risk for the development of hepatitis, 
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of the conflicting results 
      about c-kit expression in HCC and the key role played by c-kit in 
      gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) and other solid tumours, the aim of this 
      study was to determine c-kit expression in the course of hepatitis B infection. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissues in Cukurova University Faculty 
      of Medicine Department of Pathology between January 2002 and February 2006 were 
      searched restrospectively to investigate this issue. We performed 
      immunohistochemistry on biopsies of 125 patients with HBV infection, grouped as: 
      mild, moderate and severe hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC, 25 patients in each of 
      them, using anti c-kit monoclonal antibody. The severity of parenchymal 
      inflammation and of interface hepatitis was semiquantitatively graded on a 
      haematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections. Additionally, 50 more HCC, 
      formed on HBV basis, were studied to determine the prevalence of c-kit 
      overexpression. RESULTS: In cirrhotic liver, lower intensity of staining and 
      rarely c-kit positivity were present. The greatest number of the c-kit positivity 
      and higher intensity of staining was found in the livers of patients with severe 
      hepatitis and HCC. In chronic hepatitis B infection, the staining intensity was 
      parallel with the grade and stage of the disease. In the areas where fibrosis was 
      seen, c-kit positivity was rare or absent. In the HCC specimens, c-kit positivity 
      appeared both inside and around the cancerous nodes. C-kit expression was 
      observed in 62 of 75 HCC tissue specimens (82%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: C-kit 
      positivity was observed in the mitotic, proliferating and also dysplastic hepatic 
      cells. These results suggest that c-kit expression may be used as an early 
      diagnostic indicator for HBV induced HCC.

TI  - Can calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 2007-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessing the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      patients consists of periodical clinical evaluations and laboratory tests. We 
      aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in 
      IBD patients. METHODS: Ninety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 
      with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in 
      the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff 
      level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the 
      test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were 
      tested using the log-rank test. RESULTS: The calprotectin test was positive in 44 
      UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients 
      with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD 
      patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, 
      as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged 
      between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC 
      patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a 
      significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability 
      of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test 
      and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Measuring calprotectin may help to 
      identify UC and colonic CD patients at higher risk of clinical relapse.

TI  - Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery?
PG  - 1575-7
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized clinical study. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      whether shaving the incision site before spinal surgery causes postsurgical 
      infection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spine surgeons usually shave the skin of 
      the incision site immediately before surgery is performed. However, evidence from 
      some surgical series suggests that presurgical shaving may increase the 
      postsurgical infection rate. To our knowledge, no previously published studies 
      have addressed this issue. METHODS: A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo 
      spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: those in whom the site of 
      operation was shaved immediately before surgery (shaved group; 371 patients) and 
      the patients in whom presurgical shaving was not performed (unshaved group; 418 
      patients). The mean duration of anesthesia and the infection rates in both groups 
      were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The duration of anesthesia did not differ in 
      the 2 groups (P > 0.05). A postoperative infection developed in 4 patients in the 
      shaved group and in 1 patient in the nonshaved group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the 
      rate of postoperative infection.

TI  - Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a 
      better predictor than age and FSH?
PG  - 151-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine if baseline antral follicle 
      assessment may serve as additional information in predicting in vitro 
      fertilization outcome. METHODS: Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in 
      vitro fertilization outcome. From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent 
      antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the 
      planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with 
      respect to antral follicle assessment (< or = 6 or > 6), basal cycle day 3 
      follicle stimulated hormone (< or = 10 or > 10 IU/L) and maternal age (< or = 35 
      or > 35 years). RESULTS: The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in 
      the group with baseline antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with 
      antral follicle < or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient 
      age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly 
      higher in the group with antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with 
      antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with 
      advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and 
      baseline antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher 
      in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 compared to that in the group with 
      antral follicle > or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In vitro 
      fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal 
      cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral 
      follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than 
      were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a 
      marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal 
      markers.

TI  - Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less 
      more?
PG  - 306.e1-306.e4
LID - S1477-5131(15)00308-3 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage 
      of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the 
      contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral 
      testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral 
      torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a 
      synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the 
      contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury 
      to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the 
      decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular 
      torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective. PATIENTS AND 
      METHOD: We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our 
      institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical 
      examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients 
      were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of 
      developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were 
      identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 
      days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the 
      right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two 
      patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All 
      hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral 
      scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a 
      patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele 
      have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 
      4.3-11.2) follow-up. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that approaching a 
      contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a 
      scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in 
      our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have 
      brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not 
      subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. 
      Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. 
      In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does 
      not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative 
      management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord 
      injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: As parents of young children are often unaware their child is 
      overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the 
      impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and 
      understand the information they received about their overweight child after 
      weight screening. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial of different methods of 
      feedback. SETTING: Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care 
      but appointments took place at a University research clinic. PARTICIPANTS AND 
      INTERVENTION: 1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight 
      children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight 
      children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using 
      best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face 
      interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a 
      follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of 
      information from the feedback session. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and 
      accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of 
      interest. RESULTS: Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 
      from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than 
      those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). 
      Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight 
      status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements 
      meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful 
      they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of 
      recall score in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: While parents remember that 
      their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to 
      remember much of the information and advice provided about the result. TRIAL

TI  - Do Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on 
      self-reported physical and psychological symptoms? A comparative analysis.
PG  - e57

LID - e57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the Internet is commonly used to recruit samples in studies 
      of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors, it has not been 
      used to measure patient-reported well-being. As the burden of long-term chronic 
      HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to 
      research and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two samples of 
      gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in 
      outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom 
      burden. METHODS: The Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based 
      survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified 
      themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV 
      clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these 
      participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this 
      analysis. RESULTS: The Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 
      years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment 
      (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy 
      (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom 
      burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 
      0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 
      0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden 
      model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the 
      recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated 
      with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly 
      associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in 
      employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical 
      symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 
      0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited 
      via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) 
      tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in 
      employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological 
      symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 
      0.21-0.49, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data have revealed a number of differences. 
      Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological 
      symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower 
      proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data 
      collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between 
      samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring 
      inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical 
      location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based 
      sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey 
      materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.

TI  - Are home sampling kits for sexually transmitted infections acceptable among men 
      who have sex with men?
PG  - 35-43
LID - 10.1258/jhsrp.2008.007065 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is an urgent need to increase opportunistic screening for 
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in community settings, particularly for 
      those who are at increased risk including men who have sex with men (MSM). The 
      aim of this qualitative study was to explore whether home sampling kits (HSK) for 
      multiple bacterial STIs are potentially acceptable among MSM and to identify any 
      concerns regarding their use. This study was developed as part of a formative 
      evaluation of HSKs. METHODS: Focus groups and one-to-one semi-structured 
      interviews with MSM were conducted. Focus group participants (n = 20) were shown 
      a variety of self-sampling materials and asked to discuss them. Individual 
      interviewees (n = 24) had experience of the self-sampling techniques as part of a 
      pilot clinical study. All data were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
      Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: The concept of a 
      HSK was generally viewed as positive, with many benefits identified relating to 
      increased access to testing, enhanced personal comfort and empowerment. Concerns 
      about the accuracy of the test, delays in receiving the results, the possible 
      lack of support and potential negative impact on 'others' were raised. 
      CONCLUSION: The widespread acceptability of using HSKs for the diagnosis of STIs 
      could have important public health impacts in terms of earlier diagnosis of 
      asymptomatic infections and thus a decrease in the rate of onward transmission. 
      In addition, HSKs could potentially optimize the use of genitourinary medicine 
      services and facilitate patient choice.

TI  - Does rugby headgear prevent concussion? Attitudes of Canadian players and 
      coaches.
PG  - 19-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the attitudes of players and coaches to the use of 
      protective headgear, particularly with respect to the prevention of concussion. 
      METHODS: A questionnaire designed to assess attitudes to headgear was 
      administered to 63 players from four different Canadian teams, each representing 
      a different level of play (high school, university, community club, national). In 
      addition, coaches from all four levels were questioned about team policies and 
      their personal opinions about the use of headgear to prevent concussion. RESULTS: 
      Although the players tended to believe that the headgear could prevent concussion 
      (62%), the coaches were less convinced (33%). Despite the players' belief that 
      headgear offers protection against concussion, only a minority reported wearing 
      headgear (27%) and few (24%) felt that its use should be made mandatory. Common 
      reasons for not wearing headgear were "its use is not mandatory", "it is 
      uncomfortable", and "it costs too much". CONCLUSION: Although most players in the 
      study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority 
      reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that 
      rugby headgear can prevent concussion.

TI  - Does body mass index (BMI) influence morbidity and long-term survival in gastric 
      cancer patients after gastrectomy?
PG  - 284-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The long-term survival of patients with gastric cancer is 
      governed by various factors, such as the clinical stage of the cancer, the 
      patient's nutritional state, and the treatment and may be governed by the volume 
      of intraperitoneal adipose tissue. The aim of this study is to clarify the 
      relationship between the degree of the patients' body mass index and their 
      long-term survival. METHODOLOGY: Gastric cancer patients who had undergone a 
      gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy and with resection A and B according to the 
      criteria of the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer Rules were 
      subgrouped into those patients with a body mass index < 0.185 (the lower body 
      mass index group) and those patients with a body mass index > 0.210 (the higher 
      body mass index group). The patient's morbidity and long-term survival rate was 
      retrospectively compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: A significantly longer 
      mean survival rate was observed for the lower body mass index group in stage 2 
      (1667 vs. 1322 days, P = 0.0240). Also, a significantly longer mean survival rate 
      was observed for the higher BMI group in stage 3a (1431 vs. 943, P = 0.0071). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The body mass index is one of the prognostic factors of stage 2 and 
      stage 3a gastric cancer. However, it does not appear to be useful for determining 
      the prognosis of stage 1a, 1b, 3b, and 4a gastric cancers.

TI  - Is determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury 
      clinically relevant? Validation of the ASIA sacral sparing criteria in a 
      prospective cohort of 432 patients.
PG  - 809-16
LID - 10.1038/sc.2009.44 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multicenter longitudinal cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To 
      validate the prognostic value of the acute phase sacral sparing measurements with 
      regard to chronic phase-independent ambulation in patients with traumatic spinal 
      cord injury (SCI). SETTING: European Multicenter Study of Human Spinal Cord 
      Injury (EM-SCI). METHODS: In 432 patients, acute phase (0-15 days) American 
      Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)/International Spinal Cord Society neurological 
      standard scale (AIS) grades, ASIA sacral sparing measurements, which are S4-5 
      light touch (LT), S4-5 pin prick (PP), anal sensation and voluntary anal 
      contraction; and chronic phase (6 or 12 months) indoor mobility Spinal Cord 
      Independence Measure (SCIM) measurements were analyzed. Calculations of positive 
      and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) as well as univariate and multivariate 
      logistic regressions were performed in all four sacral sparing criteria. The area 
      under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) ratios of all regression 
      equations was calculated. RESULTS: To achieve independent ambulation 1-year post 
      injury, a normal S4-5 PP score showed the best PPV (96.5%, P<0.001, 95% 
      confidence interval (95% CI): 87.9-99.6). Best NPV was reported in the S4-5 LT 
      score (91.7%, P<0.001, 95% CI: 81.6-97.2). The use of the combination of only 
      voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP sensory scores (AUC: 0.906, 
      P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.871-0.941) showed significantly better (P<0.001, 95% CI: 
      0.038-0.128) discriminating results in prognosticating 1-year independent 
      ambulation than with the use of currently used distinction between complete and 
      incomplete SCI (AUC: 0.823, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.781-0.864). CONCLUSIONS: Out of 
      the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements 
      do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The 
      combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP 
      scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation 
      outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.

TI  - Does use of hydrophilic guidewires significantly improve technical success rates 
      of peripheral PTA?
PG  - 55-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether the use of hydrophilic guidewires has increased 
      the technical success rate of peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
      (PTA). MATERIAL/METHODS: We performed 125 procedures and analyzed the technical 
      success rates of PTA using the conventional guidewire first and then if needed, 
      the hydrophilic guidewire for iliac and SFA stenoses or occlusions. Angioplasty 
      was performed on 25 stenosed, 25 occluded iliac arteries and 25 stenosed, 50 
      occluded femoral arteries. The result was defined as technical success when the 
      lesion was crossed by a guidewire and balloon, then it was dilated with 
      restoration of vessel lumen and less than 30% residual stenosis and the rise in 
      ABI values was at least 0.15 after 24 hours. RESULTS: The technical success rate 
      after PTA of stenosed iliac arteries was achieved in 96% (24/25) using 
      conventional wires and 100% using hydrophilic guidewire; in iliac occlusions, the 
      rates were 60% (15/25) and 96%, respectively; in femoral stenosis - 84% (21/25) 
      and 100%; in occlusions in the first group: lesions <10 cm -64% (16/25) and 96%, 
      in the second group: lesions >10 cm -48% (12/25) and 88%. In the iliac group, 
      there was no significant difference in the success of iliac stenosis PTA. 
      However, there were significant changes in the success rates of PTA performed for 
      SFA stenosis and iliac and SFA occlusions. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we report an 
      overall improvement and high technical success rate for peripherial PTA. The use 
      of hydrophilic guidewires made significant difference to the technical success 
      rate of PTA, especially in occlusion and more complicated lesions.

TI  - Are lifetime prevalence of impetigo, molluscum and herpes infection really 
      increased in children having atopic dermatitis?
PG  - 173-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2010.09.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous infections such as impetigo contagiosum (IC), molluscum 
      contagiosum (MC) and herpes virus infection (HI) appear to be associated with 
      atopic dermatitis (AD), but there are no reports of concrete epidemiological 
      evidence. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of childhood AD with these 
      infections by conducting a population-based cross-sectional study. METHODS: 
      Enrolled in this study were 1117 children aged 0-6 years old attending nursery 
      schools in Ishigaki City, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Physical examination was 
      performed by dermatologists, and a questionnaire was completed on each child's 
      history of allergic diseases including AD, asthma, allergic rhinitis and egg 
      allergy, and that of skin infections including IC, MC and HI, as well as familial 
      history of AD. RESULTS: In 913 children (AD; 132), a history of IC, MC or HI was 
      observed in 45.1%, 19.7%, and 2.5%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression 
      analysis revealed that the odds of having a history of IC were 1.8 times higher 
      in AD children than in non-AD children. Meanwhile, a history of MC was 
      significantly correlated to the male gender, but not to a personal history of AD. 
      As for HI, we found no correlated factors in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      lifetime prevalence of IC was indeed higher in young children with a history of 
      AD.

TI  - Can routinely collected ambulance data about assaults contribute to reduction in 
      community violence?
PG  - 308-13
LID - 10.1136/emermed-2013-203133 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 'law of spatiotemporal concentrations of events' introduced major 
      preventative shifts in policing communities. 'Hotspots' are at the forefront of 
      these developments yet somewhat understudied in emergency medicine. Furthermore, 
      little is known about interagency 'data-crossover', despite some developments 
      through the Cardiff Model. Can police-ED interagency data-sharing be used to 
      reduce community-violence using a hotspots methodology? METHODS: 12-month (2012) 
      descriptive study and analysis of spatiotemporal clusters of police and emergency 
      calls for service using hotspots methodology and assessing the degree of incident 
      overlap. 3775 violent crime incidents and 775 assault incidents analysed using 
      spatiotemporal clustering with k-means++ algorithm and Spearman's rho. RESULTS: 
      Spatiotemporal location of calls for services to the police and the ambulance 
      service are equally highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, 
      primarily within intra-agency hotspots (33% and 53%, respectively) but across 
      agencies' hotspots as well (25% and 15%, respectively). Datasets are 
      statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% 
      overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two 
      police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, 
      suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the 
      police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by 
      transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of 
      police-recorded crimes. CONCLUSIONS: A hotspots approach to sharing data 
      circumvents the problem of disclosing person-identifiable data between different 
      agencies. Practically, at least half of ambulance hotspots are unknown to the 
      police; if causal, it suggests that data sharing leads to both reduced community 
      violence by way of prevention (such as through anticipatory patrols or 
      problem-oriented policing), particularly of more severe assaults, and improved 
      efficiency of resource deployment.

TI  - Is irritable bowel syndrome a diagnosis of exclusion?: a survey of primary care 
      providers, gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.
PG  - 848-58
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.47 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Guidelines emphasize that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not a 
      diagnosis of exclusion and encourage clinicians to make a positive diagnosis 
      using the Rome criteria alone. Yet many clinicians are concerned about 
      overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a 
      diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and 
      community providers. METHODS: We developed a survey to measure decision-making in 
      two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea 
      (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge 
      and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as 
      a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care 
      physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts. RESULTS: Experts were 
      less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 
      72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a 
      positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 
      4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). 
      Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and 
      consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001). Experts only rated celiac sprue 
      screening and complete blood count as appropriate in D-IBS; nonexperts rated most 
      tests as appropriate. Parallel results were found in the C-IBS vignette. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; 
      this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more 
      closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect 
      suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize 
      variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.

TI  - Is a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life a prognostic factor 
      for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients? A multivariate analysis of 
      prognostic factors of EORTC study 08975.
PG  - 1698-704
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this prognostic factor analysis was to investigate if a 
      patient's self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) provided 
      independent prognostic information for survival in non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment HRQOL was measured in 391 
      advanced NSCLC patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC Lung Cancer module 
      (QLQ-LC13). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for both 
      univariate and multivariate analyses of survival. In addition, a bootstrap 
      validation technique was used to assess the stability of the outcomes. RESULTS: 
      The final multivariate Cox regression model retained four parameters as 
      independent prognostic factors for survival: male gender with a hazard ratio (HR) 
      = 1.32 (95% CI 1.03-1.69; P = 0.03); performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) with HR 
      = 1.63 (95% CI 1.04-2.54; P = 0.032); patient's self-reported score of pain with 
      HR= 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.16; P < 0.001) and dysphagia with HR = 1.12 (95% CI 
      1.04-1.21; P = 0.003). A 10-point shift worse in the scale measuring pain and 
      dysphagia translated into an 11% and 12% increased in the likelihood of death 
      respectively. A risk group categorization was also developed. CONCLUSION: The 
      results suggest that patients' self-reported HRQOL provide independent prognostic 
      information for survival. This finding supports the collection of such data in 
      routine clinical practice.

TI  - Vaginal dose assessment in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer: Can we 
      really rely on dose-point evaluation?

LID - S1538-4721(15)00606-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.brachy.2015.11.005 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although dose-volume parameters in image-guided brachytherapy have 
      become a standard, the use of posterior-inferior border of the pubic symphysis 
      (PIBS) points has been recently proposed in the reporting of vaginal doses. The 
      aim was to evaluate their pertinence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients 
      who received image-guided brachytherapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy were 
      included. Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting 
      of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were 
      evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of 
      the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were 
      analysed. RESULTS: Mean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, 
      respectively, 2.23 +/- 1.4, 6.39 +/- 6.6, and 31.85 +/- 36.06 Gy. Significant 
      differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the 
      remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, 
      respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and 
      prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International 
      commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered 
      dose was decreased by 1.43 +/- 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The 
      delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed 
      doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. The movements of the applicator in 
      regard of the PIBS point assessed with the Digital Imaging and Communications in 
      Medicine coordinates were insignificant. CONCLUSION: The doses evaluated at PIBS 
      points are not impacted by intrafractional movements. PIBS and PIBS +2 dose 
      points allow distinguishing the plans of patients with vaginal infiltration. 
      Further studies are needed to correlate these parameters with vaginal morbidity.

      (ET-1) may play a vital role in these hemodynamic changes. We examined the 
      possible role of intradialytic changes of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of hypotension 
      and rebound hypertension during HD. METHODS: The present study included 45 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular HD. They were divided 
      according to their hemodynamic status during HD into three groups (group I had 
      stable intradialytic hemodynamics, group II had dialysis-induced hypotension, and 
      group III had rebound hypertension during HD). In addition, 15 healthy volunteers 
      were included as a control group. Pulse and blood pressure were monitored before, 
      during (every half hour), and after HD session. ET-1 level was measured at the 
      beginning, middle, and end of HD. ET-1 was measured in the control group for 
      comparison. RESULTS: Pre-dialysis levels of ET-1 were significantly higher in 
      dialysis patients compared to the controls (P < 0.001); however, they were 
      comparable in the three HD groups. The post-dialysis ET-1 level was not changed 
      significantly in group I compared with predialysis values (14.49 +/- 2.04 vs. 
      14.33 +/- 2.23 pg/ml; P = NS), while the ET-1 concentration decreased 
      significantly in group II and increased in group III in comparison to predialysis 
      values (8.56 +/- 1.44 vs. 11.75 +/- 2.51; 16.39 +/- 3.12 vs. 11.93 +/- 2.11 
      pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Altered ET-1 levels may be involved 
      in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.

TI  - Is vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency related to the development of 
      osteochondritis dissecans?
PG  - 1575-9
LID - 10.1007/s00167-014-3413-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aetiology of osteochondritis dissecans is still unclear. The aim of 
      this prospective pilot study was to analyse whether vitamin D insufficiency, or 
      deficiency, might be a contributing etiological factor in the development of an 
      OCD lesion. METHODS: The serum level of vitamin D3 in 23 consecutive patients (12 
      male and 11 female) suffering from a stage III, or stages III and IV, OCD lesion 
      (mostly stage III) admitted for surgery was measured. RESULTS: The patients' mean 
      age was 31.3 years and most of them already exhibited closed epiphyseal plates. 
      In the majority of patients (18/23), a distinct vitamin D3 deficiency was found, 
      two patients were vitamin D3-insufficient and, in three patients, the vitamin D3 
      level reached the lowest normal value. CONCLUSION: These first data show that a 
      vitamin D3 deficiency rather than an insufficiency may be involved in the 
      development of OCD lesions. Probably, with a vitamin D3 substitution, the 
      development of an advanced OCD stage could be avoided. Further analyses, 
      including morphological analyses regarding a possible osteomalacia, and 
      examination of the PTH and other determinants of the bone metabolism, should be 
      undertaken to either confirm or refute these data. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

TI  - Does timing of initial surfactant treatment make a difference in rates of chronic 
      lung disease or mortality in premature infants? An observational regional study.
PG  - 91-8
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2014.987747 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare two treatment strategies in preterm infants with or at risk 
      of respiratory distress syndrome: early surfactant administration (within one 
      hour of birth) versus late surfactant administration, in a geographically defined 
      population. OUTCOME: The primary outcome was chronic lung disease (CLD) and 
      mortality before/at 36 weeks. Secondary outcomes included: duration of mechanical 
      ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), post-natal steroids 
      for CLD and major neonatal morbidities. SUBJECTS: Premature infants born at 22-32 
      weeks' gestation between January 2006 and December 2009. SETTING: Ten neonatal 
      intensive care units (NICUs) in New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital 
      Territory (ACT), Australia. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively 
      collected data from the regional NICU database in NSW and ACT. RESULTS: Of the 
      2170 infants who received surfactant, 1182 (54.5%) and 988 (45.5%) received early 
      and late surfactant, respectively. The early surfactant group was less mature 
      (27.1 +/- 2.1 versus 29.4 +/- 2.1 weeks) and had more CLD and mortality (40.2% versus 
      20.0%). The multivariable analysis showed early surfactant to be associated with 
      less duration of ventilation, longer duration of CPAP and longer hospital stay 
      but had little or no impact on CLD/mortality. CONCLUSION: Early surfactant 
      administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not 
      appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature 
      infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an 
      alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further 
      investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these 
      results.

TI  - Is it Crohn's disease? A severe systemic granulomatous reaction to sulfasalazine 
      in patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfasalazine is a widely used anti-inflammatory agent in the 
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and several rheumatological disorders. 
      Although as many as 20% of treated patients may experience reversible, 
      dose-dependent side effects, less frequent but potentially severe, systemic 
      reactions have also been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A severe systemic reaction 
      to sulfasalazine developed in a 21-year old female with rheumatoid arthritis 
      characterized by eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis and myelotoxicity, 
      cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures. The clinical course and management of this 
      patient are presented as well as a review of the incidence and outcome of severe 
      systemic reactions to sulfasalazine. CONCLUSIONS: Granulomatous myelotoxicity and 
      enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating 
      sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of 
      corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, 
      eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 
      months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and 
      unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical 
      presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.

TI  - Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach 
      confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease?
PG  - 414-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine under what conditions lay people and health professionals 
      find it acceptable for a physician to breach confidentiality to protect the wife 
      of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). METHODS: In a study in 
      France, breaching confidentiality in 48 scenarios were accepted by 144 lay 
      people, 10 psychologists and 7 physicians. The scenarios were all possible 
      combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time 
      taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse 
      about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt 
      protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in 
      STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The importance and interactions of each factor 
      were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and 
      constructing graphs. RESULTS: The concept of breaching confidentiality to protect 
      a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and 
      psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, 
      respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his 
      wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability. A 
      cluster analysis showed groups of lay participants who found breaching 
      confidentiality "always acceptable" (n = 14), "depending on the many 
      circumstances" (n = 87), requiring "consultation with an expert" (n = 30) and 
      "never acceptable (n = 13)". CONCLUSIONS: Most people in France are influenced by 
      situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to 
      protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.

TI  - Can patients be anticoagulated after intracerebral hemorrhage? A decision 
      analysis.
PG  - 1710-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Warfarin increases both the likelihood and the mortality 
      of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), particularly in patients with a history of 
      prior ICH. In light of this consideration, should a patient with both a history 
      of ICH and a clear indication for anticoagulation such as nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation be anticoagulated? In the absence of data from a clinical trial, we 
      used a decision-analysis model to compare the expected values of 2 treatment 
      strategies-warfarin and no anticoagulation-for such patients. METHODS: We used a 
      Markov state transition decision model stratified by location of hemorrhage 
      (lobar or deep hemispheric). Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life 
      years (QALYs). Data sources included English language literature identified 
      through MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected articles, along with 
      empirical data from our own institution. The base case focused on a 69-year-old 
      man with a history of ICH and newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. 
      RESULTS: For patients with prior lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy 
      was strongly preferred, improving quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 QALYs. 
      For patients with prior deep hemispheric ICH, withholding anticoagulation 
      resulted in a smaller gain of 0.3 QALYs. In sensitivity analyses for patients 
      with deep ICH, anticoagulation could be preferred if the risk of thromboembolic 
      stroke is particularly high. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial 
      fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most 
      patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive 
      anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at 
      particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence 
      might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.

TI  - Do elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of 
      acute stroke? A cross-sectional study.
PG  - 87-93
LID - 10.1159/000369962 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among patients with acute stroke symptoms, delay in 
      hospital admission is the main obstacle for the use of thrombolytic therapy and 
      other interventions associated with decreased mortality and disability. The 
      primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population 
      correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented 
      with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire. METHODS: We 
      performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (>/=60 years) in 
      Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health 
      clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the 
      Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at >/=75%. Knowledge of stroke and 
      clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as 
      predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 367 
      elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the 
      most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an 
      ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). 
      On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to 
      lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed 
      intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and 
      Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed 
      to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate 
      subsequent clinical actions.

TI  - Are opioid dependence and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) documented in the 
      medical record? A patient safety issue.
PG  - 1007-11
LID - 10.1007/s11606-009-1043-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid-dependent patients often have co-occurring chronic illnesses 
      requiring medications that interact with methadone. Methadone maintenance 
      treatment (MMT) is typically provided separately from medical care. Hence, 
      coordination of medical care and substance use treatment is important to preserve 
      patient safety. OBJECTIVE: To identify potential safety risks among MMT patients 
      engaged in medical care by evaluating the frequency that opioid dependence and 
      MMT documentation are missing in medical records and characterizing potential 
      medication-methadone interactions. METHODS: Among patients from a methadone 
      clinic who received primary care from an affiliated, but separate, medical 
      center, we reviewed electronic medical records for documentation of methadone, 
      opioid dependence, and potential drug-methadone interactions. The proportions of 
      medical records without opioid dependence and methadone documentation were 
      estimated and potential medication-methadone interactions were identified. 
      RESULTS: Among the study subjects (n = 84), opioid dependence documentation was 
      missing from the medical record in 30% (95% CI, 20%-41%) and MMT documentation 
      was missing from either the last primary care note or the last hospital discharge 
      summary in 11% (95% CI, 5%-19%). Sixty-nine percent of the study subjects had at 
      least 1 medication that potentially interacted with methadone; 19% had 3 or more 
      potentially interacting medications. CONCLUSION: Among patients receiving MMT and 
      medical care at different sites, documentation of opioid dependence and MMT in 
      the medical record occurs for the majority, but is missing in a substantial 
      number of patients. Most of these patients are prescribed medications that 
      potentially interact with methadone. This study highlights opportunities for 
      improved coordination between medical care and MMT.

      breast cancer?].
PG  - 73-7
LID - 10.1016/j.canrad.2007.12.004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate local failure patterns in node negative 
      breast cancer patients treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy including 
      internal mammary chain only. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 92 
      internal or central-breast node-negative tumours with mastectomy and external 
      irradiation of the internal mammary chain at the dose of 50 Gy, from 1994 to 
      1998. RESULTS: Local recurrence rate was 5 % (five cases). Recurrence sites were 
      the operative scare and chest wall. Factors associated with increased risk of 
      local failure were age < or = 40 years and tumour size greater than 20mm, without 
      statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be 
      discussed for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of 
      local failure such as age < or = 40 years and larger tumour size.

TI  - Does managed care enable more low income persons to identify a usual source of 
      care? Implications for access to care.
PG  - 716-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: By requiring or encouraging enrollees to obtain a usual source of 
      care, managed care programs hope to improve access to care without incurring 
      higher costs. OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine the effects of managed care on the 
      likelihood of low-income persons having a usual source of care and a usual 
      physician, and; (2) To examine the association between usual source of care and 
      access. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of households conducted during 
      1996 and 1997. SUBJECTS: A nationally representative sample of 14,271 low-income 
      persons. MEASURES: Usual source of care, usual physician, managed care 
      enrollment, managed care penetration. RESULTS: High managed care penetration in 
      the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of 
      care for uninsured persons (54.8% vs. 62.2% in low penetration areas) as well as 
      a lower likelihood of having a usual physician (60% vs. 72.8%). Managed care has 
      only marginal effects on the likelihood of having a usual source of care for 
      privately insured and Medicaid beneficiaries. Having a usual physician 
      substantially reduces unmet medical needs for the insured but less so for the 
      uninsured. CONCLUSIONS: Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in 
      improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most 
      effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of 
      managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, 
      and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.

TI  - Is the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis apoptotic?
PG  - 778-84
AB  - PURPOSE: Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is characterized by neuronal loss in the 
      hippocampus. Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable 
      epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by 
      recurrent seizures. METHODS: We searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in 
      temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using 
      the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) 
      method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin 
      fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients 
      (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years). RESULTS: Unlike that in 
      normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining 
      neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the 
      reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. 
      Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in 
      approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and 
      activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL 
      staining. We also could not detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear 
      morphology by Hoechst-33258 or hematoxylin counterstaining. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very 
      slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons 
      dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases 
      support the latter possibility.

TI  - Does vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia have the same evolution as cervical 
      intraepithelial neoplasia?
PG  - 371-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is a little known disease which 
      could be related to risk factors different from simple HPV infections. OBJECTIVE: 
      To ascertain wheter vaginal lesions have a natural history similar to cervical 
      lesions. MATERIALS & METHODS: A retrospective study to identify patients with 
      vaginal lesions and synchronous cervical lesions through biopsy. The rate of mild 
      cervical lesions (koilocytosis, warts, CIN I with and without koilocytosis) was 
      compared with the rate of severe cervical lesions (CIN II and III, cervical 
      carcinoma) in patients with mild vaginal lesions (warts and koilocytosis, and 
      low-grade VAIN) and in patients with severe vaginal lesions (high-grade VAIN). 
      Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of "active" cervical lesions was 
      compared with the rate of "non active" cervical lesions in patients with "active" 
      versus "non active" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe 
      cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, 
      with or without koilocytosis). RESULTS: In patients with mild vaginal lesions, 
      mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical 
      lesions. In patients with "active" vaginal lesions the rate of "active" cervical 
      lesions was significantly higher than "non active" cervical lesions. The 
      differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among 
      patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) 
      were not significant. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CIN and VAIN may have 
      some common features in certain cases, i.e., if an HPV infection is proved.

TI  - Does government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income 
      individuals?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether government-funded, low-income vision care programs 
      improve use of eye care services by low-income individuals in Canada. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: 27,375 white respondents to the Canadian 
      Community Health Survey (CCHS) Healthy Aging 2008/2009. METHODS: 
      Government-funded, low-income vision care programs were reviewed. The amount of 
      assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for 
      general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The 
      utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS. RESULTS: To receive 
      low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social 
      assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian 
      Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years 
      and 5.5% aged >/=65 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 
      2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged >/=65 
      years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, 
      low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. 
      In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine 
      eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, 
      requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported 
      not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by 
      lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial 
      difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p < 0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 
      0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 
      government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often 
      than wealthy individuals.

TI  - HIF1A as a major vascular endothelial growth factor regulator: do its 
      polymorphisms have an association with age-related macular degeneration?
PG  - 47-53
LID - 10.1111/ceo.12376 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD) and the polymorphisms of HIF1A, a major vascular epithelial 
      growth factor regulator under hypoxic conditions. The associations of AMD and 
      polymorphisms of genes CFH, SKIV2L and MYRIP were also studied. DESIGN: 
      Prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven AMD patients and 80 healthy 
      subjects admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology at Pamukkale University 
      Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, were included: 45 (52%) had wet type AMD, and 42 (48%) 
      had dry type AMD. METHODS: Polymorphisms rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), 
      rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) were investigated in 
      DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples of the cases and controls by 
      dye-termination DNA sequencing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genotype distribution of 
      rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and 
      rs11549467 (HIF1A) in AMD cases and healthy controls; association between 
      genotypes and AMD subtypes. RESULTS: Given the significant difference between the 
      mean age of case and control groups (72.13 +/- 5.77 vs. 62.80 +/- 5.22, respectively) 
      (P = .000), subsequent analyses were adjusted for age. We found that having at 
      least one C allele for polymorphism rs1061170 increases AMD risk independent of 
      age (OR = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-4.81). The ancestral T allele 
      for polymorphism rs1061170 has a protective effect for AMD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 
      0.34-0.83). No statistically significant difference for distributions of other 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) emerged between patients and healthy 
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: No associations appeared between HIF1A SNPs and AMD, which 
      were studied here for the first time; however, polymorphism rs1061170 of the CFH 
      gene is associated with AMD in our population.

TI  - Detailed analysis of sputum and systemic inflammation in asthma phenotypes: are 
      paucigranulocytic asthmatics really non-inflammatory?
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/s12890-016-0208-2 [doi]
LID - 46
AB  - BACKGROUND: The technique of induced sputum has allowed to subdivide asthma 
      patients into inflammatory phenotypes according to their level of granulocyte 
      airway infiltration. There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum 
      and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory 
      phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood 
      leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate 
      how those groups compared with healthy subjects. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the 
      University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. 
      Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. RESULTS: The total 
      non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and 
      neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and 
      healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and 
      percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic 
      asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed 
      higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects 
      (p < 0.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of 
      sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an 
      increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005), with 
      paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils 
      compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and 
      fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to 
      healthy subjects (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a 
      significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, 
      and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory 
      disease.

TI  - Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic 
      Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum?
PG  - 213-6
LID - 10.1097/BOT.0000000000000490 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between injury severity surrogates and 
      other patient factors with the development and severity of heterotopic 
      ossification (HO) following open reduction internal fixation of acetabular 
      fractures treated with a posterior approach. DESIGN: Retrospective review. 
      SETTING: Academic level 1 trauma center. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-one 
      patients who were treated through a posterior approach with a minimum of 6-month 
      radiographic follow-up were identified from an acetabular fracture database. 
      INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The occurrence and severity (Brooker 
      Grade III/IV) of HO 6 months postsurgery. RESULTS: Length of stay (LOS) in the 
      intensive care unit (ICU), non-ICU LOS >10 days, and HO prophylaxis with external 
      radiation beam therapy (XRT) were significantly associated with the development 
      of HO in a multivariate model [ICU LOS: 1-2 days, odds ratio (OR) = 4.33, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 1.03-18.25; 3-6 days, OR = 4.1, 95% CI, 1.27-13.27; >6 
      days, OR = 11.7, 95% CI, 3.24-42.22; non-ICU LOS >10 days (vs. 0-6 days): OR = 
      7.6, 95% CI, 2.6-22.25; XRT HO prophylaxis: OR = 0.29, 95% CI, 0.10-0.85]. Other 
      variables evaluated in multivariate modeling not significantly associated with 
      development and severity of HO included age, gender, mechanism of injury, injury 
      severity score, presence of neurologic injury, Letournel fracture type, 
      occurrence of hip dislocation, interval from injury to surgery, operative time, 
      and estimated blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: Surrogates of injury severity, including 
      days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS >10 days, were associated with the 
      development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with 
      XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability 
      to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete 
      description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness?
PG  - 715-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
      (OSA) had an objective change in aerobic fitness during cycle ergometry compared 
      to a normal population. The most accurate test of aerobic fitness is measurement 
      of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) with cycle ergometry. METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective cohort analysis (247 patients with OSA) of VO2max from 
      annual cycle ergometry tests compared to a large control group (normative data 
      from 1.4 million US Air Force tests) in a tertiary care setting. RESULTS: 
      Overall, individuals with OSA had increased VO2max when compared to the 
      normalized US Air Force data (p < .001). Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of 
      greater than 20 demonstrated a decreased VO2max as compared to normalized values 
      (p < .001). No differences in VO2max were observed after either medical or 
      surgical therapy for OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA 
      does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. 
      However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a 
      statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal 
      population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. 
      Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is 
      needed.

TI  - 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of 
      concern and need for improvement?
PG  - 369-74
LID - 10.1007/s00068-014-0450-3 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Emergency surgery is associated with poorer outcomes and higher mortality 
      with recent studies suggesting the 30-day mortality to be 14-15%. The aim of this 
      study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 
      1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage 
      prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to 
      establish best practice in this area. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 
      patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The 
      primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality 
      and 1-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 
      patients. 57% were aged <70 and 43% aged >70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% 
      in those aged <70 years and 22% in those >70 years (p < 0.001). 1-year mortality 
      was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, 
      especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to 
      improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute 
      surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency 
      surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps 
      even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist 
      centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the 
      elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for 
      post-discharge care.

TI  - Combining process indicators to evaluate quality of care for surgical patients 
      with colorectal cancer: are scores consistent with short-term outcome?
PG  - 481-9
LID - 10.1136/bmjqs-2011-000439 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if composite measures based on process indicators are 
      consistent with short-term outcome indicators in surgical colorectal cancer care. 
      DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of consistency between composite measures based on 
      process indicators and outcome indicators for 85 Dutch hospitals. SETTING: The 
      Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit database, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 4732 
      elective patients with colon carcinoma and 2239 with rectum carcinoma treated in 
      85 hospitals were included in the analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All available 
      process indicators were aggregated into five different composite measures. The 
      association of the different composite measures with risk-adjusted postoperative 
      mortality and morbidity was analysed at the patient and hospital level. RESULTS: 
      At the patient level, only one of the composite measures was negatively 
      associated with morbidity for rectum carcinoma. At the hospital level, a strong 
      negative association was found between composite measures and hospital mortality 
      and morbidity rates for rectum carcinoma (p<0.05), and hospital morbidity rates 
      for colon carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: For individual patients, a high score on the 
      composite measures based on process indicators is not associated with better 
      short-term outcome. However, at the hospital level, a good score on the composite 
      measures based on process indicators was consistent with more favourable 
      risk-adjusted short-term outcome rates.

TI  - Are the elderly with oropharyngeal carcinoma undertreated?
PG  - 2057-63
LID - 10.1002/lary.24660 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine if elderly patients with oropharyngeal 
      squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are receiving less treatment and to evaluate the 
      benefit of aggressive therapy in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective 
      analysis of a large population database. METHODS: Patients in the Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results database with OPSCC diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 
      were included. The patients were categorized into age groups 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 
      65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years and older, then further categorized by treatment 
      status. Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-specific survival (DSS) for late-stage 
      (III and IV) OPSCC was performed for all age and treatment categories, followed 
      by a multivariate cox regression of treatment status, tumor site, race, stage, 
      and sex per age group. RESULTS: A total of 14,909 patients with OPSCC were 
      identified. In our demographic data, we observed a significant increase in the 
      number of patients who did not receive treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined 
      therapy) after age 55. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that age groups 65 to 74 and 
      75 to 84 had substantial benefits in DSS with surgery, radiation, or combined 
      therapy. Multivariable analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant 
      difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among age groups 45 to 54, 
      55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84. CONCLUSIONS: Proportionally fewer elderly 
      patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients 
      can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age 
      as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to 
      assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly 
      population.

TI  - Do older patients receive adequate stroke care? An experience of a neurovascular 
      clinic.
PG  - 115-8
LID - 10.1136/pgmj.2008.070607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: National guidelines and government directives have adopted policies 
      for urgent assessment of patients with a transient ischaemic attack or minor 
      stroke not admitted to hospital. The risk of recurrent stroke increases 
      substantially with age, as does the potential benefit of secondary prevention. In 
      order to develop effective strategies for older patients, it is important to 
      identify how stroke care is currently provided for this patient group. METHODS: 
      Between 2004 and 2006, older patients (>75 years) referred to a neurovascular 
      clinic were compared with younger patients (< or =75 years). Sociodemographic 
      details, clinical features, resource use and secondary prevention in a 
      neurovascular clinic were collected. RESULTS: Of 379 patients referred to the 
      clinic, 129 (34%) were given a non-stroke diagnosis. Of the remaining 250 
      patients, 149 (60%) were < or =75 years. Median time from symptom onset to clinic 
      appointment was similar for the two groups (24 (IQR 15-42) vs 24 (IQR 14-43) 
      days; p = 0.58). Older patients were more likely to be in atrial fibrillation 
      (10.1% vs 22.8%, p<0.001) and have lacunar stroke (34.7% vs 22.1%; p = 0.04). CT 
      rates were similar in the two groups (27.8% vs 80.0%, p = 0.75). Scans were 
      performed more quickly in younger patients (p<0.01). MRI scan rates were higher 
      in younger patients (26% vs 4%, p<0.01), as was carotid Doppler imaging (92% vs 
      77%, p<0.01). There were no differences in prescribed secondary preventive 
      treatments. Older patients experienced less delay for carotid endarterectomy (49 
      vs 90 days, p<0.01). Younger patients were more likely to be given advice on 
      weight reduction (30.2% vs 12.9%, p<0.01) and diet (46.3% vs 31.7%, p = 0.02) 
      than older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients were less likely to receive 
      diagnostic investigations and lifestyle modification advice than younger 
      patients. Guidelines need to be adopted to ensure prompt evidence-based stroke 
      care in the outpatient setting.

      opportunity for rescue?
PG  - 14-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the duration of continuing pregnancy after antenatal 
      corticosteroid (AC) administration and to evaluate the potential opportunity for 
      rescue AC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of women at 24-32 weeks' 
      gestation who received AC at one institution. RESULTS: Six hundred ninety-two 
      women received AC. Two hundred forty-seven (35.7%) delivered at > or = 34 weeks' 
      gestation. Three hundred twenty-one (46.4%) delivered within 1 week of AC; 92 of 
      those women (13.3%) delivered within 24 hours. Only 124 (17.9%) remained pregnant 
      1 week after AC and delivered at < 34 weeks. The latter were compared to women 
      delivering > 2 week after AC but > or = 34 weeks. More likely to deliver at < 34 
      weeks were those women who received AC for premature preterm rupture of membranes 
      (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.06-7.17), twins (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.42-5.95) or before 28 weeks 
      (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.38-3.52). CONCLUSION: Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of 
      cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.

TI  - Should HIV-infected patients be screened for silent myocardial ischaemia using 
      gated myocardial perfusion SPECT?
PG  - 271-9
LID - 10.1007/s00259-012-2262-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in 
      HIV-infected patients, together with chronic infection and treatments, has 
      resulted in an increased risk of silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI). The objective 
      of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for 
      screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery 
      disease. METHODS: The prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was 
      determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular 
      examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV 
      infection status, and treatment. RESULTS: Coronary artery disease was detected in 
      nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), 
      corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of 
      ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the 
      overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with 
      a diagnosis of SMI (p < 0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only 
      independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis 
      of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive 
      myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other 
      CRFs. In this subpopulation of 47 patients, the prevalence of SMI detected by 
      myocardial SPECT reached 19.2 %. CONCLUSION: In male HIV-infected patients older 
      than 52 years and with at least two other CRFs, screening for SMI using 
      myocardial SPECT was about four times more likely to be positive than in the 
      general population. This may motivate physicians to advise these patients to 
      undergo more systematic screening for SMI using this technique.

TI  - Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool 
      child?
PG  - 73-9
LID - 10.1159/000114648 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: In a prospective study 218 preschool children were 
      enrolled (stratified in 2 training programs, one specialized for phonologic 
      awareness in order to prevent dyslexia, the other consisting in training of 
      general perception) during the last year of kindergarten. After finishing the 
      first grade 131 children were compared in their reading and writing abilities. 
      RESULTS: In the whole group only a slight difference was found between both 
      training modalities concerning their writing abilities. However, children with a 
      history of hearing loss, actual hearing loss or pathologic middle ear findings 
      profited most from the specialized training program compared to the control in 
      their reading abilities. CONCLUSION: A specialized training program to improve 
      phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and 
      preschool child seems to be unnecessary. However, children with temporary hearing 
      deficits benefit from such a program. For all other children general perception 
      training may be sufficient.

TI  - BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR : are correlated 
      results possible from homebrew assays?
PG  - 187-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative real-time PCR has become the predominant molecular 
      technique to monitor BCRABL levels in response to treatment in Ph(+) leukemia 
      patients. However, without some form of standardized methodology between 
      laboratories, the correlation of results is difficult. METHODS: Using 
      TaqMan-based assays, parallel quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed 
      on 70 clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Virginia 
      Commonwealth University. While the same positive control cell line (K562) and 
      quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA 
      synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were 
      different. RESULTS: The detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic 
      range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at 
      both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 
      BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p 
      < 0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result 
      was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy 
      number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can 
      be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in 
      methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are 
      used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted 
      between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different 
      facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, 
      cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.

TI  - Does HER2 immunoreactivity provide prognostic information in locally advanced 
      urothelial carcinoma patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy?
PG  - 210-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the impact of HER2 immunoreactivity on clinical outcome 
      in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients who received surgery alone, or 
      methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, and cisplatin (M-VEC) as adjuvant 
      chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 114 formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from locally advanced urothelial carcinoma 
      patients receiving surgery alone or adjuvant M-VEC. The authors evaluated HER2 
      immunoreactivity using immunohistochemical staining and explored the influence of 
      pathological parameters and HER2 immunoreactivity on progression-free survival 
      (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) using univariate and 
      multivariate Cox's analyses. RESULTS: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder had a 
      significantly higher frequency of HER2 immunoreactivity than that of the upper 
      urinary tract (60.7 vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001). Overall, nodal status was a strong 
      and independent prognostic indicator for clinical outcome. The HER2 
      immunoreactivity was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.02) and 
      disease-specific OS (p = 0.005) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. As for 
      patients with adjuvant M-VEC, HER2 immunoreactivity was a significant prognostic 
      factor for PFS (p = 0.03) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.02) using univariate 
      analysis, but not multivariate analysis, and not for patients receiving watchful 
      waiting. CONCLUSIONS: HER2 immunoreactivity might have a limited prognostic value 
      for advanced urothelial carcinoma patients with adjuvant M-VEC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parental drinking has been shown to be associated with offspring 
      drinking. However, the relationship appears to be more complex than often assumed 
      and few studies have tracked it over longer time periods. AIMS: To explore the 
      long-term (10-year) transmission of familial drinking during adolescence to 
      offspring drinking patterns in young adulthood. DESIGN: Swedish longitudinal 
      study, assessing the relationship between familial drinking in 2000 and offspring 
      drinking in 2010 using simultaneous quantile regression analysis (n=744). DATA: 
      Data on familial drinking was gathered from the Swedish level-of-living surveys 
      (LNU) and from partner LNU in 2000 while data on offspring drinking in young 
      adulthood was gathered from LNU 2010. Drinking among offspring, parents and 
      potential stepparents was measured through identical quantity-frequency indices 
      referring to the past 12 months in 2010 and 2000 respectively. RESULTS: Young 
      adults whose families were abstainers in 2000 drank substantially less across 
      quintiles in 2010 than offspring of non-abstaining families. The difference, 
      however, was not statistically significant between quintiles of the conditional 
      distribution. Actual drinking levels in drinking families were not at all or 
      weakly associated with drinking in offspring. Supplementary analyses confirmed 
      these patterns. CONCLUSION: The association between familial drinking and 
      offspring drinking in young adulthood exhibits clear non-linear trends. Changes 
      in the lower part of the familial drinking distribution are strongly related to 
      drinking in young adults, but the actual levels of drinking in drinking families 
      appear less important in shaping the drinking patterns of the offspring in young 
      adulthood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is no standard protocol for the evaluation of antiseptics used 
      for skin and mucous membranes in the presence of interfering substances. Our 
      objective was to suggest trial conditions adapted from the NF EN 13727 standard, 
      for the evaluation of antiseptics used in gynecology and dermatology. METHODS: 
      Three antiseptic solutions were tested in vitro: a chlorhexidine-benzalkonium 
      (CB) combination, a hexamidine-chlorhexidine-chlorocresol (HCC) combination, and 
      povidone iodine (P). The adaptation of trial conditions to the standard involved 
      choosing dilutions, solvent, and interfering substances. The activity of 
      solutions was assessed on the recommended strains at concentrations of 97% (pure 
      solution), 50%, and 10% (diluted solution), and 1%. A logarithmic reduction >/= 5 
      was expected after 60seconds of contact, to meet requirements of bactericidal 
      activity. RESULTS: HCC did not present any bactericidal activity except on P. 
      aeruginosa at a concentration of 97%. P was not bactericidal on E. hirae at any 
      concentration and on S. aureus at 97%. CB had the most homogeneous bactericidal 
      activity with a reduction>5 log on the 4 bacterial strains at concentrations of 
      97%, 50% and 10%. CONCLUSION: Adapting the NF EN 13727 standard allowed assessing 
      the 3 tested solutions: only CB was bactericidal in dirty conditions. This study 
      proved the possibility of validating antiseptic choice in vitro, in current 
      practice conditions, for adjunctive treatment of skin and mucous membranes 
      disorders, primarily of bacterial origin or with a potential of superinfection.

TI  - Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein 
      cannulation? Prospective randomized comparison with landmark-guided puncture in 
      ventilated patients.
PG  - 572-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether prepuncture ultrasound evaluation of vascular 
      anatomy facilitates internal jugular vein cannulation compared with 
      landmark-guided puncture. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: Single 
      community hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients undergoing general anesthesia (n 
      = 240). INTERVENTIONS: The right internal jugular vein was cannulated using 
      either anatomic landmarks or prepuncture ultrasound (3.75/7.5 MHz) guidance. In 
      the landmark group, respiratory jugular venodilation was used as the primary 
      landmark for locating the vein. Results of cannulation and the incidence of 
      complications were compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were 
      randomly assigned to the ultrasound or landmark group. Respiratory jugular 
      venodilation was identified in 188 patients (78.3%), in whom results of 
      cannulation did not differ between the 2 techniques with respect to the venous 
      access rate (cannulated at the first attempt: 83.5% in the landmark v 85.7% in 
      the ultrasound group), the success rate (cannulated within 3 attempts: 96.9% v 
      95.6%), and the incidence of arterial puncture (1.0% v 3.3%). In the remaining 52 
      respiratory jugular venodilation-unidentified patients, the access rate (30.4% v 
      86.2%, p < 0.001) and the success rate (78.3 v 100%, p < 0.05) were significantly 
      better in the ultrasound group, and no arterial puncture was recorded in the 
      ultrasound group, whereas the incidence was 13.0% in the landmark group. The 
      results were similar regardless of the ultrasound frequency used. CONCLUSION: 
      Prepuncture ultrasound evaluation did not improve the result of right internal 
      jugular vein cannulation compared with the respiratory jugular 
      venodilation-guided approach. When the landmark was not observed, however, the 
      prepuncture ultrasound guidance was helpful in facilitating the cannulation.

TI  - Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably?
PG  - 509-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphedema may be identified by simpler circumference changes as 
      compared with changes in limb volume. METHODS: Ninety breast cancer patients were 
      prospectively enrolled in an academic trial, and seven upper extremity 
      circumferences were measured quarterly for 3 years. A 10% volume increase or 
      greater than 1 cm increase in arm circumference identified lymphedema with 
      verification by a lymphedema specialist. Sensitivity and specificity of several 
      different criteria for detecting lymphedema were compared using the academic 
      trial as the standard. RESULTS: Thirty-nine cases of lymphedema were identified 
      by the academic trial. Using a 10% increase in circumference at two sites as the 
      criterion, half the lymphedema cases were detected (sensitivity 37%). When using 
      a 10% increase in circumference at any site, 74.4% of cases were detected 
      (sensitivity 49%). Detection by a 5% increase in circumference at any site was 
      91% sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of 5% in circumference measurements 
      identified the most potential lymphedema cases compared with an academic trial.

TI  - Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic 
      pregnancy? An appraisal of the evidence.
PG  - 101-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To critically assess the evidence that appendiceal perforation is a 
      risk factor for subsequent tubal infertility or ectopic pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: 
      Epidemiologic studies investigating the relationship between appendectomy and 
      infertility or ectopic pregnancy were identified by searching the MEDLINE 
      database from 1966 to 1997. Appropriate citations were also extracted from a 
      manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. STUDY SELECTION: 
      Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including 
      comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. 
      DATA EXTRACTION: Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis 
      were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted 
      from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them 
      to a common measure. DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles were assessed according to the 
      criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on 
      harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility 
      outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic 
      pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility 
      from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for 
      confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance 
      of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of 
      perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the 
      data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased 
      ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a 
      definitive answer.

TI  - Does perspective-taking increase patient satisfaction in medical encounters?
PG  - 1445-52
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181eae5ec [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether perspective-taking, which researchers in other fields 
      have shown to induce empathy, improves patient satisfaction in encounters between 
      student-clinicians and standardized patients (SPs). METHOD: In three studies, 
      randomly assigned students (N = 608) received either a perspective-taking 
      instruction or a neutral instruction prior to a clinical skills examination in 
      2006-2007. SP satisfaction was the main outcome in all three studies. Study 1 
      involved 245 third-year medical students from two universities. Studies 2 and 3 
      extended Study 1 to examine generalizability across student and SP 
      subpopulations. Study 2 (105 physician assistant students, one university) 
      explored the effect of perspective-taking on African American SPs' satisfaction. 
      Study 3 (258 third-year medical students, two universities) examined the 
      intervention's effect on students with high and low baseline perspective-taking 
      tendencies. RESULTS: Intervention students outscored controls in patient 
      satisfaction in all studies: Study 1: P = .01, standardized effect size = 0.16; 
      Study 2: P = .001, standardized effect size = 0.31; Study 3: P = .009, 
      standardized effect size = 0.13. In Study 2, perspective-taking improved African 
      American SPs' satisfaction. In Study 3, intervention students with high baseline 
      perspective-taking tendencies outscored controls (P = .0004, standardized effect 
      size = 0.25), whereas those with low perspective-taking tendencies did not (P = 
      .72, standardized effect size = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: Perspective-taking increased 
      patient satisfaction in all three studies, across medical schools, clinical 
      disciplines, and racially diverse students and SPs. Perspective-taking as a means 
      for improving patient satisfaction deserves further exploration in clinical 
      training and practice.

      Documentation of four cases].
PG  - 570-4
LID - 10.1007/s00113-014-2650-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sternal fractures in childhood are rare. The aim of the study was to 
      investigate the accident mechanism, the detection of radiological and 
      sonographical criteria and consideration of associated injuries. METHOD: In the 
      period from January 2010 to December 2012 all inpatients and outpatients with 
      sternal fractures were recorded according to the documentation. RESULTS: A total 
      of 4 children aged 5-14 years with a sternal fracture were treated in 2 years, 
      2 children were hospitalized for pain management and 2 remained in outpatient 
      care. CONCLUSION: Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to 
      typical age-related traumatic incidents. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic 
      tool for fracture detection and radiography is the method of choice for 
      visualization of the extent of the dislocation.

TI  - Midwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?
PG  - 764
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in 
      tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the 
      result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key 
      consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently 
      provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated 
      and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. 
      Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, 
      regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' 
      identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide 
      effective and safe care for low-risk women. METHOD: This was a comparative 
      questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity 
      units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. 
      Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 
      midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units. RESULTS: The response 
      rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from 
      midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who 
      reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there 
      were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in 
      the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 
      0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as 
      intravenous fluid replacement (p <0.001) and initial and discharge examination of 
      the newborn (p <0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing 
      professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an 
      educational event within the last month (p <0.001). Lack of time was a greater 
      barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater 
      for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly 
      higher in urban units (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: It is often assumed that midwives 
      in rural areas where there are fewer deliveries, will be less competent and 
      confident in their practice. Our exploratory study suggests that the issue of 
      competence is far more complex and deserves further attention.

TI  - Does the severity of obstructive sleep apnea predict patients requiring high 
      continuous positive airway pressure?
PG  - 951-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate polysomnographic and anthropomorphic factors 
      predicting need of high optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 
      DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-three 
      consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual 
      CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean 
      optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an 
      increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the 
      moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was 
      defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD; > or =12 cm H2O). The predictor 
      variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), 
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High 
      CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, 
      moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS 
      score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing 
      high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of 
      high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in 
      severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the 
      receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. 
      However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical 
      value of such information is limited. ESS and MSLT did not increase the 
      predictive value for the need for high CPAP.

TI  - Does self-efficacy mediate the relationship between transformational leadership 
      behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality? A longitudinal study.
PG  - 1833-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05039.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to investigate the longitudinal 
      relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and employees' sleep 
      quality, and the mediating effects of self-efficacy. BACKGROUND: Although there 
      is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health 
      outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) 
      or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of 
      well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with 
      working conditions. METHODS: A longitudinal design was used to collect data from 
      Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 
      2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the 
      relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep 
      quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. 
      RESULTS: For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline 
      level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality 
      were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, 
      but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership 
      and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that training managers in transformational 
      leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health 
      over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which 
      transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy 
      was not found to be the explanation.

TI  - Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone 
      populations in manitoba?
PG  - 366-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Francophones may experience poorer health due to social status, 
      cultural differences in lifestyle and attitudes, and language barriers to health 
      care. Our study sought to compare mental health indicators between Francophones 
      and non-Francophones living in the province of Manitoba. METHODS: Two populations 
      were used: one from administrative datasets housed at the Manitoba Centre for 
      Health Policy and the other from representative survey samples. The 
      administrative datasets contained data from physician billings, hospitalizations, 
      prescription drug use, education, and social services use, and surveys included 
      indicators on language variables and on self-rated health. RESULTS: Outside urban 
      areas, Francophones had lower rates of diagnosed substance use disorder (rate 
      ratio [RR] = 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and of suicide and suicide attempts (RR = 
      0.59; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79), compared with non-Francophones, but no differences 
      were found between the groups across the province in rates of diagnosed mood 
      disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, or any mental disorders after adjusting 
      for age, sex, and geographic area. When surveyed, Francophones were less likely 
      than non-Francophones to report that their mental health was excellent, very 
      good, or good (66.9%, compared with 74.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancy in how 
      Francophones view their mental health and their rates of diagnosed mental 
      disorders may be related to health seeking behaviours in the Francophone 
      population. Community and government agencies should try to improve the mental 
      health of this population through mental health promotion and by addressing 
      language and cultural barriers to health services.

TI  - Outcome Feedback within Emergency Medicine Training Programs: An Opportunity to 
      Apply the Theory of Deliberate Practice?
PG  - 367-73
LID - 10.1017/cem.2014.47 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Outcome feedback is the process of learning patient outcomes after 
      their care within the emergency department. We conducted a national survey of 
      Canadian Royal College emergency medicine (EM) residents and program directors to 
      determine the extent to which active outcome feedback and follow-up occurred. We 
      also compared the perceived educational value of outcome feedback between 
      residents and program directors. METHODS: We distributed surveys to all Royal 
      College-accredited adult and pediatric EM training programs using a modified 
      Dillman method. We analyzed the data using student's t-test for continuous 
      variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: We received 
      210 completed surveys from 260 eligible residents (80.8%) and 21 of 24 program 
      directors (87.5%) (overall 81.3%). Mandatory active outcome feedback was not 
      present in any EM training program for admitted or discharged patients (0/21). 
      Follow-up was performed electively by 89.4% of residents for patients admitted to 
      the hospital, and by 44.2% of residents for patients discharged home. A majority 
      of residents (76.9%) believed that patient follow-up should be mandatory compared 
      to 42.9% of program directors (p=0.002). The perceived educational value of 
      outcome feedback was 5.8/7 for residents and 5.1/7 for program directors 
      (difference 0.7; p=0.002) based on a seven-point Likert scale (1=not important; 
      7=very important). CONCLUSION: While Canadian EM training programs do not mandate 
      follow-up, it is performed electively by the majority of residents surveyed. 
      Residents place a significantly greater educational value on outcome feedback 
      than their program directors, and believe that follow-up should be a mandatory 
      component of EM residencies.
